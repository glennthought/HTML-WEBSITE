                                    command as the highest-ranking surviving military personnel. Bright's commands
                                    include the White Base, the shuttle Temptation, Anti Earth Union Group's Argama, the
                                    entire AEUG fleet, and Londo Bell's Ra Cailum.<br><br>Bright Noa is a loyal and

                                    sabers, blades of extremely hot plasma which could cut through any metal with ease.
                                    Those beam sabers could be extended into a spear-like beam javelin, which could be
                                    used to stab into an enemy from a longer distance.</p>

                                    Zaku II Commander Type (an overall improved MS-06F Zaku II) painted in his personal
                                    red colors.[1][2] Being a commander's unit, a horn-like decoration was also attached
                                    to its head.[1] Despite the high risks, Char personally ordered the removal of its
                                    limiters, allowing it to use its thrusters to the maximum limit.[1] The hit-and-run
                                    tactics enabled by the resulting high thrust, and the impression its distinctive
                                    colors made on the battlefield, led to Char's nick name, "Red Comet".[1] After the
                                    Clash of Loum, Vice Admiral Dozle secretly ordered Char to command the Falmer, a
                                    custom Musai-class battleship, and unit emblems and victory markings were applied to
                                    his MS-06S.[2][3] These included bright white lines indicating it as the commander's

                                    to continue its development. In response, Zeonic developed a new mobile suit based
                                    on the design of the MS-05.[1] The prototype for this mobile suit rolled out in
                                    August, U.C. 0077.[2] Originally intended as an improved model of the MS-05, this
                                    prototype was instead given the new model number of MS-06A due to its signficantly
                                    different appearance and vastly improved performance, marking the birth of the MS-06
                                    Zaku II.[1]</p>

                                    Gundam.<br><br>The RGM-79 GM was a mass-produced mobile suit based on the RX-78-2
                                    Gundam. Its basic frame was easily adaptable to modifications into mission-specific
                                    GM models, and had a fairly high level of mobility for the time, both on Earth and
                                    in space. It had a maximum acceleration of 0.94 G in space, which was better than
                                    the Zaku and even the Gundam. On Earth's surface, the GM was also faster than the
                                    Zaku II. The armor of the GM was made from Titanium Alloy, a sturdy metal that could
                                    be refined more quickly and easily than the Gundam's Luna Titanium Alloy. Although
                                    Titanium Alloy is less durable than Luna Titanium Alloy, it is slightly lighter,

                                    Guntank, is a mobile suit from the Mobile Suit Gundam television
                                    series.<br><br>The RX-75 Guntank was the first prototype Earth Federation Forces
                                    mobile suit developed by Operation V. However, it was said to be closer to a tank
                                    rather than a mobile suit. A number of companies such as Takim and Hervic
                                    participated in its development. The Guntank had the torso and arms of a mobile
                                    suit, but possessed caterpillar treads for legs. Initially, it was designed to be
                                    piloted by a crew of two, with a gunner in the canopy-style cockpit on the head and
                                    a driver in another cockpit in the torso. However, it was later changed to be
                                    controlled by a single pilot in the canopy-style cockpit. Like all "Operation V"
                                    mobile suits, the Guntank used the Core Block System.<br><br>

                                    Its reactor is a hybrid type of nuclear reactors and gas turbines, and its output is
                                    insufficient for powering beam weapons. The Guntank's main weapons are twin 120mm
                                    cannons, which are effective at long and medium ranges. Its arms have four-barrel
                                    missile launchers instead of hands, and they provided good cover fire against enemy
                                    tanks and aircraft, but are less effective against enemy mobile suits. A major flaw
                                    of the Guntank is its inability to turn its torso, making it difficult to aim the
                                    cannons at moving targets, as the Guntank must reposition itself. Another major flaw
                                    is that its design was primarily for ground combat, resulting in it having poor
                                    maneuverability in space./p>

                                    known pilot is Ramba Ral.<br><br>The MS-07B Gouf is designed specifically for
                                    Earth-based, close-quarter MS combat. It featured much-improved mobility with a
                                    powerful backpack and leg-mounted thrusters for jet-assisted jumps based on the
                                    YMS-08A High Mobility Test Type. For armaments, it has the 5-barrel 75mm machine gun
                                    in its left hand and a heat rod, which could be used as a superheated slicing weapon
                                    or as a grappling weapon with a powerful electric shock effect. It also had a
                                    powerful heat sword stored within a shield, and could also use the standard Zaku II
                                    weapons, such as the 120mm machine gun or the 280mm bazooka.<br><br>

                                    The Gouf outclassed the MS-06 Zaku II in terms of speed, power output, and melee
                                    combat ability, but its overall performance was not great enough to be justified by
                                    its increased cost. The Gouf's production was cut short by the development of a more
                                    cost efficient unit, the more powerful and nimble MS-09 Dom. Despite its very short
                                    production run, several variations were produced in limited numbers and it was still
                                    deployed across the world alongside Zakus and Doms. One customized unit was piloted
                                    by Visch Donahue, which had the original 5-fingered machine gun left hand replaced
                                    by a normal manipulator hand, in its place a 3-barrel 35mm machine gun was mounted
                                    on the left forearm.</p>

                                    timeline.<br><br>Early History
                                    Like the Earth Federation, the origin of the Earth Federation Forces predates the
                                    Universal Century. By some accounts, it was formed from the United Nations Forces in
                                    A.D. 2009.[1] Compared to the former United Nations Forces, the EFF was given far
                                    more power, allowing the Earth Federation government to respond to regional
                                    conflicts and natural disasters far more efficiently.[2]<br><br>

                                    The deployment of EFF to regional conflicts continued into the Universal Century.
                                    However, after the Earth Federation declared the eradication of conflicts on Earth
                                    in U.C. 0022, these conflicts began reducing in scale. In response, the Earth
                                    Federation Forces began a gradual reduction of armaments.[2]<br><br>

                                    At this point, the EFF was made up of only three branches: Ground Force, Navy and
                                    Air Force. Even as space colonization expanded the Federation's territory into
                                    space, the EFF did not create a space force.[2]<br><br>

                                    Creation of the Space Force
                                    By the U.C. 0040s, however, Spacenoids - second generation space immigrants - began
                                    increasingly demanding autonomy. In response, the Federation government founded the
                                    Earth Federation Space Force (EFSF) in the U.C. 0050s. In U.C. 0058, in response to
                                    Side 3's declaration of independence as the Republic of Zeon, the EFF initiated the
                                    60s Military Armament Enhancement Plan, a plan to reorganize the entire EFF with the
                                    Space Force at its center.[2]<br><br>

                                    As part of this plan, two new military organizations were formed, the Department of
                                    Space Force and the Department of Earth Force, with the latter in charge of the
                                    Ground Force, the Navy and the Air Force. Since the development of new space
                                    colonies was frozen at the time, the Space Force was given a massive budget. In
                                    addition, since current-duty military officials were able to become assemblymen in
                                    the Federation assembly, a political faction derisively nicknamed "Federation
                                    warlords" began arising within the Federation government.[2]<br><br>

                                    Even though the Republic of Zeon was used to justify this expansion of military
                                    power, the Republic of Zeon's military power was far too weak for a war with the
                                    Federation. In addition, the Republic's founder Zeon Zum Deikun sought to obtain
                                    independence and autonomy through diplomatic means. It was believed that the true
                                    goal for the creation and enhancement of the EFSF was to enhance the Federation
                                    garrison in colonies and increase the political pressure on all Sides.[2]<br><br>n
                                    U.C. 0079, the Principality of Zeon declared war on the Earth Federation. Due to
                                    Zeon's use of new tactics and weapons, including mobile suits, Minovsky particle
                                    interference, and even the use of a space colony as a projectile, the Earth
                                    Federation Forces was completely caught by surprise and suffered massive casualties
                                    in the early stage of the war. To make matters worse, General Johann Abraham Revil
                                    was captured during the disastrous Battle of Loum.<br><br>

                                    Under the effects of Minovsky particle interference, guided weapons and
                                    computer-based fire-control systems were rendered useless, leaving the Federation
                                    space fleets helpless against Zeon's mobile suits. Following General Revil's rescue
                                    and the Antarctic Treaty, Zeon began their Earth Landing Operations. As the
                                    battlefield shifted to Earth, the Federation Ground Force found their communications
                                    severed by Minovsky particle interference and their guided weapons similarly
                                    unusable, causing them to lose large swaths of territory to Zeon's Earth Attack
                                    Force.<br><br>

                                    However, the tide of the war began shifting as the Federation began its mobile suit
                                    development program: the RX Project and Operation V. The 13th Autonomous Corps,
                                    which carried three Operation V prototype mobile suits back to Earth, not only
                                    collected valuable combat data for the future development of mobile suits, but
                                    managed to kill Garma Zabi, commander of the Earth Attack Force, throwing Zeon
                                    forces on Earth into chaos. Taking advantage of Garma's death, the Federation Ground
                                    Force launched Operation Odessa, a large-scale European counteroffensive, which
                                    ended up recapturing the single largest Zeon base on Earth, shifting the battlefield
                                    into space.<br><br>

                                    Following the loss of Odessa, Zeon launched a last-ditch attack on the EFF
                                    headquarters at Jaburo after Zeon ace pilot Char Aznable discovered its secret
                                    entrance. However, the attack was repelled, allowing the EFF to launch its space
                                    counteroffensive. Soon after, the Earth Federation Space Force captured the Zeon
                                    space fortress Solomon and renamed it "Confeito", using it as a staging point for
                                    the next phase of the counteroffensive.<br><br>

                                    Prior to the Battle of A Baoa Qu, Zeon wiped out a third of the Federation attack
                                    force using the super weapon Solar Ray, killing General Revil. Though the Federation
                                    won the battle and took A Baoa Qu, it was too exhausted to launch the planned
                                    offensives against Granada and the Zeon homeland. Ultimately, on January 1, U.C.
                                    0080, the Earth Federation and the Republic of Zeon signed the Granada Treaty,
                                    ending the war.

                                <p>The Republic of Zeon is a nation featured in the Mobile Suit
                                    Zeta Gundam television series and the Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn OVA. It existed
                                    before the Principality of Zeon and later would become its successor state.<br><br>
                                    In U.C.0053, Zeon Zum Deikun was appointed Prime Minister of Side 3. On September
                                    14, U.C.0058, Side 3 declared independence and established the Republic of Zeon. In
                                    U.C.0068, Deikun suddenly died of a heart attack during a parliamentary speech. When
                                    Degwin Sodo Zabi took control, he wiped out the opposition and abolished the
                                    Republic on August 15, 0069, and declared a transition to a monarchy. The Zabi
                                    family, having gained power, aimed for independence from the Federation government
                                    by force. On January, U.C. 0079, the Zeon War of Independence (One Year War) began.
                                    With the destruction of the Zabi family during the closing stages of the One Year
                                    War, the Principality of Zeon transitioned to a Republic just before the end of the
                                    war and returned to its name of Republic of Zeon. During the First Neo Zeon War in
                                    U.C.0088, Side 3 along with the Republic, came under control of Neo Zeon and would
                                    eventually be liberated by the AEUG and Federation fleet after the self-destruction
                                    of Neo Zeon.<br><br>

                                    Following the One Year War, the Republic of Zeon was created with a pro-Earth
                                    Federation government led by Darcia Bakharo. Although regarded by some as a
                                    Federation puppet government, the Republic had been granted a degree of autonomy.
                                    However, the Federation planned to dissolve the Republic by U.C. 0100, which would
                                    cause the name of Zeon and his Newtype theory to fade into obscurity. Republic of
                                    Zeon defense minister Monaghan Bakharo would devise the Co-Prosperity Sphere plan
                                    and sponsored the Neo Zeon remnants movement, known as the Sleeves, led by Full
                                    Frontal to continue the fight for Spacenoid independence. When the Vist Foundation
                                    offered them Laplace's Box, an enigmatic object that had the power to topple the
                                    Federation government, Frontal intended to use it as a time saver to forestall the
                                    dissolution of the Republic so it could help in the formation of the Side
                                    Co-Prosperity Sphere, which would boycott the Earth, forcing mass space migration
                                    and causing the Federation government to collapse. However, following the defeat of
                                    the Sleeves in the Laplace Incident, the Republic of Zeon retired their independence
                                    in U.C. 0100 and was folded back into the Earth Federation.
