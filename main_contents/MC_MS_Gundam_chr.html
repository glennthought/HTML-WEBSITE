                            <p>The year is U.C. 0093. At Anaheim Electronics' factory in Von Braun on the Moon, Earth
                                Federation Forces officer Chan Agi and Anaheim technician October Saran examine the
                                RX-93 ν Gundam. Agi is hastily preparing the new Gundam for deployment because Char
                                Aznable has declared war on the Earth Federation and Newborn Neo Zeon is in the process
                                of dropping the asteroid Fifth Luna on the city of Lhasa, the site of EFF
                                headquarters.<br><br>

                                In the streets of Lhasa, a group of delinquents run away from Federation police. Among
                                the teenagers is Quess Paraya, the rebellious daughter of Federation Vice-Minister of
                                Foreign Affairs Adenauer Paraya. Quess is apprehended and taken back to her father, who
                                has been tasked with an urgent diplomatic mission in space. Adenauer, his mistress
                                Kathy, and Quess take a plane to the spaceport in Hong Kong. Along the way, Quess and
                                her father argue about the Federation enforcing its edicts onto Spacenoids.<br><br>

                                In space, the Fifth Luna drop operation is being coordinated by Nanai Miguel. The Londo
                                Bell taskforce arrives to try and destroy the asteroid. Cyber Newtype Gyunei Guss, in
                                the MSN-03 Jagd Doga, was guarding Fifth Luna against Amuro Ray in the RGZ-91 Re-GZ.
                                However, they are intercepted by Char Aznable, piloting his MSN-04 Sazabi. Amuro argues
                                that dropping the asteroid will cause a nuclear winter, but Char is certain in his
                                belief that the selfish Federation officials living on Earth must be eradicated or else
                                planet will become uninhabitable anyway. Char and Gyunei retreat as the asteroid reaches
                                the point of no return.<br><br>

                                <p>After the First Neo-Zeon War, Amuro joins the Earth Federation's Londo Bell group led
                                    by Bright Noa, and served as the combat squad commander. During the Second Neo-Zeon
                                    War, Amuro is assigned to the battleship Ra Cailum, Londo Bell's flagship, as the
                                    leader of the ship's mobile suit squads. Amuro initially pilots the RGZ-91 Re-GZ,
                                    but Anaheim Electronics soon delivers to him the RX-93 ν Gundam, a highly advanced
                                    mobile suit largely designed by Amuro himself. It is widely believed that his
                                    relatively low status in the Earth Federation is a sign of the government's
                                    continued mistrust in Newtypes.

                                    At the end of the Second Neo-Zeon War, after defeating Char's MSN-04 Sazabi in the
                                    duel and capturing Char's escape pod, Amuro attempted to singlehandedly stop the
                                    asteroid Axis from colliding with the Earth by pushing the asteroid with his RX-93 ν
                                    Gundam. His action inspired other mobile suit pilots to join in, even Neo-Zeon
                                    soldiers. Although he eventually succeeded, the act overloaded ν Gundam's
                                    Psycho-Frame construct. Both he and Char disappeared in a magnificent aurora, thus
                                    ending his long-time legacy of combat since the One Year War and concluding the most
                                    famous Mobile Suit Gundam rivalry at last.

                                <p>In December, U.C. 0092, he reappears as Char Aznable (also known as Char Deikun in
                                    the novels), the leader of the Newborn Neo Zeon, and decides to purge the people of
                                    Earth, who have experienced many wars but continue to oppress the spacenoids in the
                                    same old manner. Taking advantage of his fame as the "Red Comet," the ace of the old
                                    Zeon Dynasty and the orphaned son of Zeon Zum Deikun, he enlists the remnants of the
                                    old Neo Zeon army, Nanai Miguel, Gyunei Guss, and other talented officers, and
                                    maintains a small but elite force. He then declares the occupation of Sweetwater in
                                    the Earth Sphere with his own naval vessels against the Federation government, which
                                    has been out of the war for some time. At the end of February, in the end of U.C.
                                    0093, he effectively declares war on the Federation government in a television

                                    with his fleet.
                                    Although he encountered resistance from Londo Bell, an emerging unit of the
                                    Federation Forces to which Amuro Ray and Bright Noa belonged, he himself launched a
                                    sortie in the mobile suit Sotheby's and succeeded in dropping the Fifth Luna
                                    asteroid on Lhasa, Tibet, the location of the Federation Forces'
                                    headquarters.<br><br>



                                    After that, he negotiates a fake peace deal with Adenauer Paraya, a high-ranking
                                    officer of the Federation Forces, at Londenion on Side 1, whereby he receives the
                                    Axis asteroid on condition that he is disarmed, and immediately raids Luna II and
                                    captures the nuclear weapons that had been deployed there. He then decides to drop
                                    Axis on Earth in order to bring a nuclear winter to the planet. In order to protect
                                    Axis, he engages in a desperate battle with Londo Bell, even forcing Quess Paraya,
                                    who adores him, to fight.<br><br><br><br>
                                    On March 12, U.C. 0093, he fights Amuro, who is
                                    piloting the RX-93 ν Gundam, in the Sazabi to settle the score for the last time,
                                    but is defeated. At that time, he is caught in an escape pod and disappears into the
                                    light of the Psycho-Frame, along with Amuro, who holds Axis from falling. Axis then
                                    changes course, and the mission ends in failure. The whereabouts of the two men
                                    after that are said to be completely unknown.<br><br>Aftermath<br><br>Note: The

                                    "Portrait in Red: Char and to Frontal," which included footage from "Mobile Suit
                                    Gundam," "Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam," and "Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack,"
                                    looked back on Char's life up to the present and depicted Char's disappearance
                                    during "Axis Shock" and the process of his thoughts coming to haunt Full
                                    Frontal.<br><br>

                                    Together with Amuro, Char was surrounded by the light of the Psycho-Frame that
                                    pushed Axis out of the way, and he felt that this light was so warm and gentle that
                                    he remembered the warmth of Lalah and the other women. In the light, Char became
                                    angry and cried like a child, and understood that the light of the Psycho-Frame was
                                    the consensus of all people emanating from the Earth, which was activated through
                                    the medium of the Psycho-Frame. He understood that even his own anger and despair
                                    were part of this light, and he reflected to himself that he had been too busy with
                                    miscellaneous things, that he too had been a fool. As Amuro's voice fades away and
                                    he hears the voice of a baby somewhere in the distance, Char says goodbye to his
                                    sister Sayla and leaves for a world where he can see the time. Becoming a part of
                                    the whole, Char found himself in the abyss of space. It was dark, cold, and
                                    bottomless, and the Earth was so far away that it was impossible to distinguish it
                                    from the light of the stars. Even the rainbow-colored light of the Psycho-Frame that
                                    had enveloped him earlier could not reach him here, and even if it had, he
                                    understood that it was meaningless because there was no life that could recognize
                                    the light as light. The imaginable area was closed off by darkness, and no
                                    civilization, or even a life form standing at its doorway, could be recognized. Char
                                    determined that, on the scale of the universe, it takes only a moment for a
                                    civilization to be born and then collapse, and therefore, humanity is a meaningless
                                    existence that marks a momentary glow in this universe and returns to nothingness.
                                    He thought that if he became a Newtype, he would be able to control even time with
                                    that warm light, but that was a dream, and even if he saw that rainbow that
                                    enveloped the Earth, mankind has not changed and will not change. Humanity is so far
                                    from the truth that it has not even acquired the means to transcend light, and it
                                    grows and perishes in the space within its reach.</p>

                                    Quess is selfish, stubborn, emotionally sensitive, intelligent, naive, and love
                                    obsessed. Quess was born as a latent Newtype. When she wants to have something,
                                    she'll demand for it and believe it's rightfully hers even if she can't have it.
                                    Even though there are people around her to remind her about manners and respect, she
                                    doesn't listen well, and people tend to tolerate her or excuse her due to the fact
                                    she's still a developing teen.<br><br>

                                    She developed a crush on Amuro Ray and often shows her affection to him. Despite her
                                    lack of interest, she received the unrequited affection of Hathaway Noa. When she
                                    was taken in by Char to train her as a MS pilot, she was completely enthralled by

                                    of Mobile Suit Gundam Hathaway. He was the son of Bright and Mirai Noa [1].<br><br>
                                    After Char Aznable decided to drop an asteroid on the Earth, Hathaway and his family
                                    attempted to escape the doomed Earth at Hong Kong Spaceport. They were initially
                                    turned away from a departing space shuttle, but intervention from Adenauer Paraya
                                    allowed only Hathaway to board the shuttle. The shuttle was caught in a battle with
                                    Neo Zeon, but were rescued by the Ra Cailum, commanded by Bright. While on the Ra
                                    Cailum, Hathaway got to know Quess more, discussing such topics as Newtypes and
                                    Char's actions. Amuro, Hathaway and Quess later visited the Londenion colony,
                                    meeting Char in person. As Amuro got into a fist fight with Char, Quess also
                                    followed to intervene, leaving Hathaway to watch from the side. In the final battle
                                    to stop Axis from colliding with Earth, Hathaway got into a Jegan and launched. He
                                    tried to persuade Quess in her NZ-333 α Azieru to stop fighting but Quess had
                                    already lost her mind and did not listen to his reasoning. Chan Agi in a damaged
                                    RGZ-91 Re-GZ fired on the Alpha Azieru, killing Quess. Grief-stricken, Hathaway
                                    returned fire and destroyed the Re-GZ, killing Chan and releasing the Psycho-Frame
                                    sample she had [3].

                                    According to Hathaway, the incident of him piloting the Jegan against military
                                    regulations was overlooked due to the Federation victory [4].

                                    is best known as the last potential love interest of Amuro Ray.<br><br>Chan is a
                                    technical officer for Londo Bell who helps Amuro supervise the development of his ν
                                    Gundam during the Second Neo Zeon War. Her relationship with Amuro earns her the
                                    wrath of Quess Paraya, who calls her a "disgusting hag" and ultimately betrays Amuro
                                    when he attempts to stop Char Aznable before he carries out his plan to drop the
                                    Axis asteroid onto Earth.<br><br>

                                    Throughout this conflict, Chan is constantly looking out for Amuro and becomes
                                    deeply concerned about the last-minute addition of a Psycho-Frame to the Nu Gundam,
                                    which is why she keeps a T-shaped sample with her for further study. When Londo
                                    Bell's main battleship, the Ra-Cailum, comes under attack, Chan mans one of the
                                    ship's gun turrets and successfully takes out Neo Zeon ace Rezin Schnyder, with a
                                    little help from the psycho-frame. However, she is shocked upon hearing about the
                                    death of Londo Bell ace Kayra Su at the hands of Gyunei Guss. Amuro, who was present
                                    at this incident, is very upset and says he is prepared to give his life to end
                                    Char's, worrying Chan. He later assures Chan that he won't let his emotions get the
                                    better of him in battle and kisses her. However, Chan is not convinced and takes off
                                    in a damaged RGZ-91 Re-GZ to find him. She is followed by Hathaway Noa, who is
                                    determined to get Quess back from Char, in a Jegan.<br><br>

                                    The two of them confront Quess, who by this time has become rather unstable from all
                                    the enhancements she received, while she is piloting the massive mobile armor α
                                    Azieru. Hathaway pleads with Quess to come back, but she ignores him and tells Chan
                                    that she could have stayed with Amuro if it weren't for her. Chan accidentally fires
                                    a missile in the direction of the two younger pilots, but Quess jumps in front of
                                    Hathaway and takes the hit, dying as her Alpha Azieru explodes. Enraged, Hathaway
                                    fires back and kills Chan. However, in his final battle against Char, Amuro says
                                    that he can sense her presence as the psycho-frame she was studying appears

                                    animated film Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack. It was designed and piloted
                                    by Amuro Ray.<br><br>The RX-93 ν Gundam was one of the most advanced mobile suits
                                    during the Second Neo Zeon War in U.C. 0093, and was used by Amuro Ray who was also
                                    involved in designing the machine. It was manufactured at Anaheim Electronics' Von
                                    Braun plant and hastily completed in a short period of time (about three months)
                                    under the supervision of chief engineer October Saran.[1][2] Its design was based on
                                    the average specification values of each successive generations of Gundam-type units
                                    from the original RX-78-2 Gundam to the MSZ-010 ΖΖ Gundam, and updated with
                                    state-of-the-art technologies introduced at the time.[3] Test data collected by
                                    various mobile suits, such as the YRA-90A μ Gundam and the RX-9 Narrative Gundam,
                                    were also used in its development.<br><br>

                                    The ν Gundam's design focuses on versatility and operational aspects, and emphasizes
                                    reliability and durability for protracted battles.[3] It adopts unitized parts that
                                    are designed according to EFF standards, except for the Psycho-Frame, for easier
                                    procurement of parts and materials and reducing special components as much as
                                    possible. It can be easily repaired due to maintenance feedback and combat data. In
                                    addition, it reflects Amuro Ray's experience as an MS pilot cultivated over the
                                    years.<br><br>

                                    The Psycho-Frame technology, which was secretly provided to Anaheim Electronics by
                                    Char Aznable of Neo Zeon, was used around the mobile suit's cockpit and joints,
                                    improving its flexibility and follow-up capabilities. The Psycho-Frame also enabled
                                    ν Gundam to utilize Psycommu weapons and channel the emotions and mental energies of
                                    a Newtype pilot. The ν Gundam is also the first Gundam-type machine to be equipped
                                    with Funnels, and a newly developed MS control program is installed to account for
                                    the mobile suit's center of mass during separation and movement of the Funnels.[3]
                                    Overall, the ν Gundam proved to be a formidable mobile suit and when combined with
                                    ace pilot Amuro's skill and experience, this state-of-the-art machine played a
                                    critical role in the Second Neo Zeon War, and its Psycho-Frame was put to the test
                                    to determine the fate of humanity living on Earth.

                                    the leader of his own Neo Zeon faction in U.C. 0093, he ordered his engineers to
                                    create a new mobile suit which would fit his piloting skills and Newtype powers. The
                                    result was the MSN-04 Sazabi, which was later built by the Luna-based contractor
                                    Anaheim Electronics.[1][2] With an overall height of 25.6 meters, the Sazabi is much
                                    bigger than most standard mobile suits, but thanks to the use of lightweight armor
                                    materials and a great number of thrusters [3] it is much faster and maneuverable
                                    than other suits. The suit is armed with an abdomen-mounted scattering mega particle
                                    cannon, a beam shot rifle, a pair of beam sabers stored in the arms and a shield
                                    with three missiles as well as a beam tomahawk.<br><br>

                                    Because Char is a Newtype, the Sazabi was also equipped with six funnels which the
                                    pilot could control through his psycowaves via a Psycommu system. The Sazabi was
                                    also the first MS to be equipped with the revolutionary new Psycho-Frame cockpit.
                                    This system featured microscopic psycommu receiver circuits installed throughout a
                                    mobile suit's internal frame and cockpit walls. These tiny circuits amplify and
                                    transmit a Newtype pilot's psycowaves, enabling the mobile suit to respond
                                    instantaneously to mental commands.

                                    Alloy Ceramic Composite armor, as well as high operability, and excellent
                                    versatility.[2][5] All these allows it to become the "next-generation standard MS",
                                    and it operated as the main force MS for a long period of time.[2][4][6] Several
                                    variations of the MS were also developed.[2] The original Jegan is sometimes
                                    referred to as "Jegan Type-A" to differentiate it from later variants, and should
                                    not be confused with the later RGM-89R Jegan A-Type.[7]<br><br>

                                    The Jegan highly exemplified the original concept of MS being "mobile infantry for
                                    melee combat", and is designed for close combat in and around space
                                    colonies.[2][5][6] It can also operate under gravity without any modifications.[6]
                                    With a backpack containing a single main thruster, two small thrusters at the
                                    bottom, and two articulated vernier arms at the top, the Jegan's thrust and
                                    acceleration performance could match high-mobility-type machines from the Gryps
                                    War-era.[2][6] Its backpack also featured exchangeable propellant tanks.[2][6] Also
                                    notable are the verniers for attitude controls on the front shoulder armor, enlarged
                                    centre shoulder armor sections to fit the side thrusters, and a calf-mounted
                                    thruster on each leg.[2] The use of lightened armor grants the machine high
                                    maneuverability, its front skirt armor is removed to maintain the legs' range of
                                    articulation, while its head has a long-range sensor installed in the forehead in
                                    addition to the fixed main sensors.[2][3][5] The Jegan is armed with mainly
                                    short-range weaponry, including a beam saber, a short-range type beam rifle, three
                                    hand grenades, a vulcan pod system, and a shield with twin missile launchers.[3][4]

                                    purpose mobile suit with technology and design features descended from the old
                                    MS-06F Zaku II.[1] It is developed based upon the design of an Axis machine taken
                                    out by members of Neo Zeon following the group's defeat at the end of the First Neo
                                    Zeon War. Since the resources of Char's Neo Zeon are limited, the Geara Doga was not
                                    a particularly high-performing unit when compared to the machines used by Haman
                                    Karn's Neo Zeon four years earlier; however, it was well in line with the style of
                                    mobile suit design of the day.[2] Its performance was also sufficient for most
                                    soldiers, easy to mass-produce and remains a threat for the Earth Federation's own
                                    mass-produced suit, the RGM-89 Jegan.[1]<br><br>

                                    The Geara Doga has a wide variety of weapons to cope with different combat
                                    situations. Its only fixed armaments are a beam sword-axe for close combat and an
                                    shock anchor. It can be equipped with a shield with four grenade launchers and two
                                    different types of beam machine guns, with one capable of mounting additional
                                    weaponry. The Geara Doga is fitted with old Zeonic-style mono-eye head sensors able
                                    to detect targets at a longer range and thus make a faster offensive; however, when
                                    within combat range, the sensor's performance becomes limited in terms of
                                    target-tracking.[3] The basic specifications of this machine is for space combat,
                                    and a backpack for long-distance cruising is standard equipment. With its
                                    versatility, maneuverability, and maintainability, the Geara Doga combines all the
                                    necessary factors as a practical weapon while earning the trust of mechanics and
                                    pilots in the field.</p>

                                    suit based on the MSZ-006R Zeta Plus R. It was introduced in the anime movie Mobile
                                    Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack.<br><br>The Re-GZ was developed by Anaheim
                                    Electronics as a simplified variant of the company's masterpiece, the MSZ-006 Zeta
                                    Gundam.[1] Consideration for mass-production was taken into account,[2] and it aimed
                                    for a lower cost than the limited-production Zeta Plus series.[3] The basic design
                                    of the Re-GZ's body follows that of the Zeta Gundam's MS form while parts such as
                                    the arms are shared with the RGM-89 Jegan.[3] The transformation mechanism was
                                    considered too costly to mass-produce, and was removed in favor of a special Back
                                    Weapon System (BWS),[4] which the Re-GZ can dock with to change to a Waverider-like
                                    form.<br><br>

                                    The BWS was developed with reference to subflight systems such as the Base Jabber
                                    and FXA-05D G-Defenser,[3] and in particular, the MSZ-006R Zeta Plus R (a machine
                                    with a large detacheable backpack) from the Zeta Plus series.[3][4] The BWS is armed
                                    with additional beam weapons and propellant tanks. As the Re-GZ was developed during
                                    a time where large-scale battles did not occur[5][6] and it was more expensive than
                                    other MS, so only one prototype was built.[5] Despite the Re-GZ boasting high
                                    specifications that outclassed other mass-production machines,[4] it struggled
                                    against Neo Zeon's Newtype-use mobile suits[1] in U.C.0093 due to a lack of Psycommu

                                    involving forces from the old Principality of Zeon. These organizations were
                                    established at three different times in the Universal Century continuity, once just
                                    after the defeat of the Titans, another formed four years after the defeat of the
                                    first Neo Zeon movement and three years after the second Neo Zeon movement.
                                    <br><br>In U.C. 0093, Zeon Zum Deikun's son, Casval Rem Deikun (aka Zeon's legendary
                                    ace, Char Aznable, the "Red Comet"), created a second Neo Zeon known as the "Newborn
                                    Neo Zeon (新生ネオ・ジオン Shinsei Neo Jion?)". This movement was founded under the
                                    ceremonial goal of "speeding up" the space migration of all of humanity, so the
                                    theoretical evolution of humanity into Newtypes could be realized. Char's plan
                                    involved a series of massive asteroid drops against the Earth, ultimately leading to
                                    an eternal nuclear winter, rendering the planet uninhabitable. The final collision
                                    attempt was to involve the Axis asteroid, headquarters of the previous Neo Zeon
                                    movement. The plan was ultimately foiled by the Federation's Londo Bell taskforce,
                                    headed by Bright Noa, and Char's old adversary from the One Year War, Amuro Ray.

                                <p>Londo Bell was established on March 21, U.C.0090, after the First Neo Zeon War, and
                                    was tasked with investigating and fighting anti-Earth Federation activities. The
                                    name "Londo Bell" comes from "the bell of Londenion (the old name of London meaning
                                    'wasteland')", and also means "one who rings the alarm bell in times of
                                    emergency".[1] Its headquarters were located in Londenion in Side 1, and among the
                                    organization's ranks were former AEUG and Karaba members. Londo Bell was first
                                    commanded by Bright Noa, with its mobile suit combat squads led by ace pilot Amuro
                                    Ray.<br><br>In U.C. 0093, former Zeon officer/AEUG leader Char Aznable returned,
                                    after being
                                    missing-in-action following the Gryps War. After occupying the refugee colony
                                    Sweetwater without firing a single shot, he publicly declared himself the new leader
                                    of Neo Zeon, and shortly thereafter started a new war against the Federation. As a
                                    countermeasure, the military rapidly increased the size of Londo Bell in
                                    anticipation of the Second Neo Zeon War, which began in March UC 0093, backed by
                                    high-level government official John Bauer. During this conflict, Londo Bell was
                                    comprised of three Clop-class cruisers: the Ra Zyme, the Ra Kiem and the Ra Chutter,
                                    along with the flagship Ra Cailum. Its mobile suit squadrons consisted of 18 RGM-89
                                    Jegans, a RGZ-91 Re-GZ and Amuro's personal unit, the RX-93 ν Gundam. Londo Bell was
                                    the only active group that saw major action against Char's Neo-Zeon, although
                                    Federation reinforcements were dispatched to assist much later on. (Char's

                                    The Third Neo Zeon War (0096 U.C.) was a comparatively brief insurgency spearheaded
                                    by the Neo Zeon remnant group known as the Sleeves, led by Full Frontal. They were
