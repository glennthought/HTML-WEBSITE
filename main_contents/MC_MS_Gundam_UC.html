                                Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn (機動戦士ガンダムUCユニコーン Kidō Senshi Gandamu Yunikōn?) is 2010
                                theatrical OVA series based on the novel series of the same name written by Japanese
                                author Harutoshi Fukui, with character and mechanical designs provided by Yoshikazu
                                Yasuhiko and Hajime Katoki, respectively, and music by Hiroyuki Sawano. The series is
                                available to be streamed on Funimation and Hulu.<br><br>The story begins in UC 0001, at
                                the very beginning of human space colonization, with the Laplace terror incident, a
                                major event that influences the course of human history forever. The main story takes
                                place in UC 0096, three years after the events of Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's
                                Counterattack and seventeen years after the One Year War.

                                <p>Banagher Links (バナージ・リンクス Banāji Rinkusu?) is the main protagonist of the Mobile Suit
                                    Gundam Unicorn novel, its OVA adaptation, and the television recut. Originally a
                                    student at Anaheim's Technical College, he became the pilot of the RX-0 Unicorn
                                    Gundam, the key to Laplace's Box. He also makes an appearance in the Mobile Suit
                                    Gundam Narrative film.<br><br>Banagher is a well meaning young man, although the
                                    novels describe him as constantly having a "disjointed" feeling and looking for a
                                    deeper purpose other than his everyday life, until he meets Mineva and the Unicorn
                                    Gundam. No matter the circumstances, he cares a lot about the safety and well being
                                    of other people, regardless of whether they're fighting with or against him. As a
                                    result of his good natured personality, he often tries to hold back when fighting
                                    opponents, resorting to non-lethal methods of subduing them as best he can.<br><br>

                                    At times, he can be a bit naive, such as when he thought to have Laplace's Box
                                    handed over to the Sleeves, despite not knowing what its contents and potential
                                    consequences would be. Despite this, he holds the belief that people's identities
                                    and actions are not bound by blood or familiar ties, and that people should have the
                                    freedom to find their own path in life. This is heavily reflected in his actions and
                                    behavior, such as his insistence on calling Mineva Lao Zabi "Audrey" despite her
                                    true identity being revealed to him, caring little about her status as the heir to
                                    the Zabi name, and his resolve in freeing Loni Garvey from her bloodthirsty quest
                                    for vengeance for the loss of her family at the hands of the Federation, insisting
                                    that it was not her duty to enslave herself to the wishes of her father.<br><br>

                                    Ironically, in an almost hypocritical fashion, he questions to the point of personal
                                    frustration what his father Cardeas Vist had in mind when he gave him the Unicorn
                                    Gundam, and how he intended Banagher to overcome the obstacles that lay before him.
                                    As such, when he feels lost or questions whether or not what he's doing is right or
                                    wrong, he hesitates to take action. However, when he figures out what he needs to do
                                    with the power given to him, he's displayed an iron will with little regard to his
                                    own safety, such as when he sortied in the Unicorn Gundam to drive off the Sleeves
                                    forces in an effort to protect Mineva in spite of the odds stacked against him, or
                                    when he angrily beat Suberoa Zinnerman, a man much larger and stronger than him, to
                                    convince him of his hypocrisy in allowing the Zeon Remnants to destroy Torrington in
                                    light of the circumstances surrounding his late wife and child, even though he was
                                    at gunpoint.</p>

                            <div class="inner-content">

                                <p>Full Frontal (フル・フロンタル Furu Furontaru?) is one of the main antagonists of Mobile Suit
                                    Gundam Unicorn. He was the mysterious leader of the Neo Zeon remnant forces, the
                                    Sleeves and pilots his own custom mobile suit, the MSN-06S Sinanju.<br><br>
                                    Full Frontal was the leader of the Neo Zeon remnant group known as the Sleeves. He
                                    was described as "The Second Coming of Char". Like Char Aznable, he was a Caucasian
                                    man with blond hair whose face is hidden behind a mask, wears a red uniform, and
                                    pilots a red custom mobile suit, the Sinanju.<br><br>

                                    In actuality, he was a genetically altered near identical Cyber Newtype copy of
                                    Char. His memories were implanted from the Psycho-Frame that absorbed the "Will" of
                                    Char that drifted through space. He possesses the remnant thoughts of Char (part of
                                    his soul) which were distorted in despair because humanity did not change after
                                    witnessing the miracle that occurred during "Axis Shock".[1] Later when witnessing
                                    the miracle again with Banagher, he was contacted by the spirits of Char Aznable and
                                    Lalah Sune who told him it's time for him to move on. Full Frontal's "spirit" then
                                    merged back with Char's.[2]<br><br>

                                    Full Frontal's features had been surgically altered and cybernetically programmed to
                                    become a near-identical duplicate of Char. His face and voice closely resemble that
                                    of Char's, even possessing the diagonal scar above the bridge of his nose the late
                                    Captain had received while fencing with Amuro Ray at A Baoa Qu. Nahel Argama's
                                    captain Otto Mitas, while watching archived footage of Char, remarked on the
                                    keenness of the similarities. As with Char, he held the Neo Zeon remnants together
                                    with his charisma, intelligence, and combat capabilities. Full Frontal is fully
                                    aware of his status as Char's clone, but understood the importance of symbolism and
                                    remained in guise as long as people needed Char Aznable to lead them. His charisma
                                    was equal to his manipulative nature and at one point tried to recruit Banagher
                                    Links with diplomacy rather than force. His ultimate goals were to undermine the
                                    Earth Federation's power, its role in space and to give Spacenoids the ability to
                                    self-govern by revealing the contents of Laplace's Box.<br><br>

                                    Unlike Char however, Full Frontal displays a deep-set sense of nihilism, brought on
                                    by the ceaseless horrors of war between the Federation and Zeon and his own warped
                                    existence, possessing a distorted fragment of Char's "soul". Although he uses his
                                    charisma and charm to persuade those around him, they are a complete facade hiding
                                    his actual ambivalence for the wellbeing of Spacenoids.</p>

                                <p>Angelo Sauper (アンジェロ・ザウパー Anjiero Zaupā?) is a character introduced in the OVA Mobile
                                    Suit Gundam Unicorn. A young member of the Sleeves who serves as the devoted
                                    commander of Full Frontal’s royal guard, he held the rank of
                                    Lieutenant.[1]<br><br>Angelo was prepared to carry out any dastardly maneuver if
                                    Frontal ordered him to do so. For him, the principle of action was "whether it was
                                    for Frontal's benefit or not," and he had no interest in their merits. The only
                                    thing that motivated Angelo was his debt to Frontal, who had rescued him from a
                                    hellish situation. His desire for revenge against Banagher was also quite strong,
                                    but it did not shake his loyalty to Frontal.<br><br>

                                    In order to realize the "Side Co-prosperity Sphere" concept that Frontal had
                                    launched, Angelo did not object to a joint struggle with the hostile Nahel Argama.
                                    Although there was some rejection of working with them, he did not want to go
                                    against the policies of his trusted commander.</p>

                                    Neo Zeon.
                                    In Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn, she uses the alias Audrey Burne (オードリー・バーン Ōdorī
                                    Bān?) to disguise her true identity.<br><br>Mineva is overall a kind, focused,

                                    royalty, Mineva didn't embrace the Zeonic movement like her family members. Tired of

                                    of peace; she's not interested in ruling nor inheriting her royal legacy. In wanting

                                    and sacrifice herself for the good of both Earth and space.</p>

                                    upbringings have sheltered Riddhe's views on the world. Though he is the heir to the
                                    influential Marcenas family, he enlisted in Londo Bell to escape his family that he
                                    is uncomfortable talking about. He believes that the Earth Federation, even when
                                    there was corruption, would eventually do the right thing. Riddhe is also a believer
                                    in luck. For that reason, whenever he goes into combat, he wears a bracelet with a
                                    miniature biplane attached, which he calls his good luck charm. However, his views
                                    eventually change, and he is willing to disobey the rules in favor of doing what is
                                    right. After being told the truth about Laplace's Box and his own family, Riddhe
                                    became determined to protect the current world order and the billions of lives that
                                    reside within it, even though it's flawed.<br><br>

                                    Things would dramatically change after he encountered Princess Mineva Lao Zabi and
                                    learned of his family's legacy in relation to the Laplace Box. Despite knowing the
                                    true nature of the Laplace Box, Riddhe still wanted to preserve the current twisted
                                    world order for the sake of peace. However, his beliefs clashed with the princess
                                    and despite his constant efforts to protect her, she rejected his ideals wanting to
                                    reveal Laplace's Box instead. His recent series of failures and rejection from
                                    Mineva caused him to have a growing hatred for Newtypes, Gundams, his misfortunes,
                                    his inherited legacies, and, albeit especially, Banagher. Ironically, Riddhe himself
                                    is a Gundam pilot and a Newtype. Being manipulated by his own rage, Alberto Vist
                                    gave Riddhe the Banshee Gundam to prevent the opening of the Laplace Box. However,
                                    after he killed Marida Cruz in combat, her spirit calmed his anger and he realized
                                    the depth of his errors and decided to side with Banagher and his group in hopes of
                                    a better future.</p>

                                <p>Marida Cruz (マリーダ・クルス Marīda Kurusu?), also known as Ple Twelve, is a clone of Elpeo
                                    Ple who appeared in the Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn OVA series. She initially served
                                    as a female Cyber Newtype pilot for the Glemy Faction during the Second Neo Zeon
                                    War, and later became an ace pilot of the Neo Zeon remnant forces Sleeves during the
                                    Laplace Incident.<br><br>Marida is shown to be an empathetic and caring person who
                                    avoids inflicting unnecessary damage and doesn't want to hurt most people
                                    emotionally, although she is usually described as emotionless and scary by others.
                                    Although highly competent in battle, she is not combative and will only fight due to
                                    her orders or wanting to protect those she cares about. Marida tends to act as a big
                                    sister and mentor figure to those younger than her, as children on Palau cling to
                                    her and call her "Big Sis", as well as her mentoring role to Banagher Links and
                                    Mineva Zabi later on. Marida is fiercly loyal to her captain, Suberoa Zinnerman,
                                    seeing him as a father figure and referring to him as "master", which irritates him.
                                    She sees herself as a weapon who does not think and carries out her orders
                                    faithfully.<br><br>

                                    After meeting with Banagher, and particularly after her recovery from the RX-0
                                    Unicorn Gundam 02 Banshee's cockpit, her hitherto unseen kindness begins to become
                                    more apparent. The true depth of her attachment to Zinnerman is later revealed, when
                                    instead of "master" as she once had, she calls him "father". Ultimately, Marida
                                    becomes as a surrogate daughter to Zinnerman.</p>

                                <p>The RX-0 Unicorn Gundam (ユニコーン ガンダム Yunikōn Gandamu?, or Unicorn, Unicorn Gundam 01,
                                    Singularity One) is the titular mobile suit of the Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn novel,
                                    its OVA adaptation and the television re-cut. It was developed by Anaheim
                                    Electronics for the Earth Federation as part of the UC project. It was piloted by
                                    Banagher Links during the Laplace Incident.<br><br>Produced as the final part of the
                                    E.F.S.F's reorganization plan, the "UC Project", the Unicorn Gundam is a
                                    revolutionary design meant to be the main symbol of the project's main goal: to
                                    destroy any traces of Zeonism in the Earth Sphere.[1] Thus, not only does it feature
                                    a Gundam design, but it also incorporates an anti-Newtype system. Two prototype
                                    machines were completed at Anaheim Electronics' factory in Granada. However, when
                                    the Vist Foundation took control of the project, they installed a special "La+
                                    Program" OS into the Gundam, turning it into a symbol of possibility by making it
                                    the key to finding Laplace's Box: the embodied hope of the Universal Century.
                                    Featuring the most advanced mobile suit technology of the time, its performance is
                                    unmatched.<br><br>

                                    Incorporating test data from the experimental MSN-06S Sinanju Stein, the Unicorn
                                    Gundam's entire frame is built with Psycho-Frame material, drastically increasing
                                    the unit's responsiveness and allowing it to be piloted like an extension of the
                                    pilot's body. While mobile suits used during the Second Neo Zeon War implemented
                                    psycho-frame technology on a limited basis, the Unicorn is the first "full
                                    psycho-frame" mobile suit. In some cases, this responsiveness is so high that the
                                    machine appears to act on its own without any actions from the pilot. In addition,
                                    the Unicorn utilizes a special system known as the "NT-D" (or Newtype Destroyer)
                                    which activates the suit's psycho-frame and dramatically increases the suit's
                                    performance.<br><br>

                                    In its normal form, the "Unicorn Mode", the Unicorn Gundam's head is similar in
                                    appearance to those of Londo Bell's mass-produced mobile suits, with the addition of
                                    a single, horn-like antenna on its forehead (which gives it the name "Unicorn").
                                    Destroy Mode is the form when Unicorn Gundam's NT-D System is activated. The
                                    transformation is marked by an expansion of the suit's frame. The armor seams
                                    separate and lock down into various hard-points, while the newly exposed
                                    psycho-frame emits a pinkish-red or greenish (Awakened) glow (attributed to the
                                    Psycho-Field phenomenon). In this mode, the Unicorn becomes taller, reveal six more
                                    thrusters, and its head transforms to one with standard Gundam features, the visor
                                    and face guard retracts into the head to reveal the twin eyes and mouth plate, and
                                    the antenna splitting into a V-fin. To prevent its transformation being interrupted,
                                    the strength of its I-Field will be increased temporarily. Additionally, a pair of
                                    sub-sensors are revealed on the shoulders, and two concealed beam sabers extend out
                                    of the backpack.<br><br>

                                    In Destroy Mode, the Unicorn Gundam's psycho-frame scans the pilot's thoughts and
                                    directly transmits them to the suit's drive system; in other words, the Unicorn can
                                    be controlled by thoughts alone. Additionally, the mode also causes the machine's
                                    performance - in thrust, generator output, and sensory radius - to be increased to
                                    unmeasurable levels. The NT-D also allows the Unicorn to take control of an enemy's
                                    psycommu weapons (also known as "Psycommu Jack") by emitting a Psycho-Field.
                                    However, the stress placed on the mind by manipulating an object more than tenfold
                                    the size of an average human is extraordinary. Even with the aid of the
                                    psycho-frame, the pilot's mind can only endure roughly five minutes of operation
                                    before a limiter is activated, deactivating the psycho-frame and returning the
                                    mobile suit to its Unicorn Mode.<br><br>

                                    With the performance limiters disengaged, the Unicorn can accelerate up to 20 G's in
                                    Destroy Mode;[2] to alleviate such high levels of G forces placed on the pilot, a
                                    drug administration system called the "DDS" is fitted on the pilot suit.[3] It
                                    suppresses stagnated blood circulation due to high acceleration by administering the
                                    drug to the pilot.[3] Furthermore, the DDS activates automatically upon the
                                    detection of another Newtype via the "Intention Automatic System".[3]</p>

                                <p>The MSN-06S Sinanju (aka Sinanju) is a mobile suit featured in the Mobile Suit Gundam
                                    Unicorn novel, its OVA adaptation and the television re-cut. A modified version of
                                    the MSN-06S Sinanju Stein, it was piloted by Full Frontal.<br><br>Originally the
                                    MSN-06S Sinanju Stein was developed by Anaheim Electronics as part of the Earth
                                    Federation's "UC Project". Its movable frame is partly made from Psycho-Frame
                                    materials. This mobile suit was then stolen and modified into the MSN-06S Sinanju by
                                    the Neo Zeon remnant group known as "The Sleeves", and became the personal machine
                                    of the group's leader, Full Frontal.<br><br>

                                    All of the Gundam-like features (except for the head-mounted vulcan guns) in the
                                    Sinanju Stein have been replaced with a Zeonic design and weaponry. Painted in
                                    crimson and with gold engraving, the Sinanju looks like the emblem of the Neo Zeon
                                    forces embodied. This decoration not only strengthens the armor, but is also said to
                                    be a design that is meant to control the organization known as the Neo Zeon
                                    remnants. The Sinanju Stein was an experimental machine, so there were some concerns
                                    about the armor's resistance to elasticity. In order to increase the pilot's chance
                                    of survival, the Sinanju's beam coating was strengthened from the two-layer
                                    structure used in most conventional MS to a five-layer structure, the entire cockpit
                                    block was covered with Luna Titanium X material, and the armor was strengthened as a
                                    flagship machine.<br><br>

                                    The Sinanju is also equipped with thrust deflector thrusters shaped like the large
                                    wings of a bird of prey, and flexible thrusters on the left and right sides of both
                                    legs and shins. Together with the numerous thrusters located all over its body, it
                                    is capable of acrobatic maneuvering combat that is impossible for a normal MS to
                                    achieve. With its overwhelming combat ability, crimson body, and mono-eye sensor,
                                    the Sinanju reminds all who see it of the legendary "Red Comet".</p>

                                    technology, including the installation of Psycho-Frame around its cockpit. Since Neo
                                    Zeon lost the ability to manufacture Psycho-Frame following the Second Neo Zeon War,
                                    the Kshatriya became a one-off unit.[1] Another factor that contributed to its
                                    miniaturization was that most of its functions are concentrated in its four
                                    wings/binders.[1][2] As a result, the Kshatriya was almost half the size of its
                                    predecessor. The four massive wings/binders are also the Kshatriya's greatest
                                    features, each containing two mega particle cannons, a funnel container with six
                                    funnels, an I-Field generator, flexible thrusters, a propellant tank, and a sub-arm
                                    equipped with a small beam saber.[1] Each wing/binder also serves as an AMBAC
                                    unit.[1] Like its predecessor, the Kshatriya requires a powerful Newtype pilot.[1]

                                <p>The YAMS-132 Rozen Zulu (ローゼン・ズール Rōzen Zūru?) is a mobile suit featured in the
                                    Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn novel, its OVA adaptation and the television re-cut. It
                                    was piloted by Angelo Sauper.<br><br>The YAM-132 Rozen Zulu is based on the concept
                                    of the experimental mobile suit AMX-103 Hamma Hamma, and was designed as a Psycommu
                                    warfare mobile suit for non-Newtype pilots. Like the Hamma Hamma, both of the Rozen
                                    Zulu's arms contain wire-guided weapons that function as INCOMs, ending in claws
                                    that could be used as a melee weapon. The mobile suit is equipped with petal-shaped
                                    remote control devices, the "Psycho Jammer", which disrupts the connection and
                                    function of enemy Psycommu-guided weapons and systems. For defensive purposes, it
                                    carries a shield which has three built in mega particle cannons and an I-Field
                                    generator. This shield is later replaced by the wired shield unit that is mounted on
                                    the right arm to replace the destroyed arm-mounted INCOM. The Rozen Zulu is actually
                                    a heavily modified AMS-129 Geara Zulu (Angelo Sauper Use) using spare parts of the
                                    MSN-06S Sinanju. As a result, the suit has Psycho-Frame installed around the cockpit
                                    but as it is not intended for Newtype use. The suit is also incorporated with
                                    Quasi-Psycommu system so that normal pilots can control the arm-mounted INCOMs
                                    effectively.</p>

                                <p>he RX-0 Unicorn Gundam 02 Banshee (aka Banshee) is a mobile suit that appears in
                                    Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn. It is built alongside its sister unit, the RX-0 Unicorn
                                    Gundam, under the Earth Federation's UC Project. Originally piloted by Marida Cruz,
                                    it was later assigned to Riddhe Marcenas.<br><br>After its completion alongside the
                                    Unicorn Gundam, the Banshee was eventually stationed on Earth with the Augusta
                                    Research Lab and tested for atmospheric combat. Rather than that of a Unicorn, the
                                    Banshee's motif is that of a lion, illustrated with gold accents on the forehead, a
                                    golden collar to signify a lion's mane (the Banshee originally had the same collar
                                    as the Unicorn but this was changed after it suffered damages while battling in
                                    space), and a much more elaborate horn/V-fin.<br><br>

                                    The Banshee's armor is almost entirely black, and its psycho-frame emits a
                                    golden-orange glow when the NT-D is activated. Although the Banshee lacks the
                                    Unicorn's distinctive La+ System, its performance in atmospheric combat is vastly
                                    superior, presumably because of a significant reconfiguring of the suit's operating
                                    system to account for Earth's gravity and the atmosphere's frictional
                                    resistance.<br><br>

                                    Combat improvements were made according to Unicorn Gundam's battle data, which had
                                    been relayed to the Augusta Research Lab. However, the two Gundams have no major
                                    operating differences. Aside from lacking the Unicorn's La+ operating system, the
                                    Banshee's raw performance is equal to that of the Unicorn. In other words, any
                                    modification to the Banshee (i.e. atmospheric combat performance) could also be
                                    applied to the Unicorn, making both suits equal in ability.<br><br>

                                    In the anime version, it weighs more than Unit 1 and has a larger effective sensor
                                    radius. Its armament also differs from that of Unit 1, as it is equipped with the
                                    added psycho-frame armaments "Armed Armor BS" and "Armed Armor VN", granting it
                                    better continuous battle capability than Unit 1, and it is said to have a higher
                                    degree of completion.</p>

                                <p>The NZ-999 Neo Zeong is a Mobile Armor introduced in the Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn
                                    OVA and was piloted by Full Frontal.<br><br>The NZ-999 Neo Zeong was developed as an
                                    exclusive machine for Full Frontal, it consisted of the MSN-06S Sinanju being
                                    carried in a huge 116 meters tall hull unit. This massive base attack mobile armor
                                    has an impressive array of beam weapons, including wire-guided funnel bits located
                                    in its hands and several mega particle cannons on its body. The funnel bits can also
                                    hijack other enemy mobile suits and turn them against one another. For defense, the
                                    machine has multiple I-Field generators. The Neo Zeong's deadliest weapon however is
                                    the large psycommu armament, the Psycho Shard Generator, which can actualize the
                                    pilot's thoughts.<br><br>

                                    The Sinanju serves as the core unit for the Neo Zeong and can utilize its beam
                                    sabers or rocket bazookas with its free hands. Thanks to an enhanced psycho-frame
                                    cockpit, the Neo Zeong can be piloted by Full Frontal's mind through his mask
                                    without being in the cockpit and utilize its weapons perfectly. Mounted at the
                                    bottom of the Neo Zeong is a pair of sturm boosters, a combination of propellant
                                    tank and booster unit, that grant better mobility and cruising range. Should the
                                    boosters be destroyed, the Neo Zeong can rely on the skirt armor's own thrusters for
                                    mobility.</p>

                                    timeline.<br><br>Laplace Incident<br><br>The Laplace Incident (ラプラス事変 Rapurasu
                                    Jihen?) was a series of military conflicts in U.C. 0096 between the Earth Federation
                                    and the remnant Neo Zeon group nicknamed "The Sleeves", three years after the end of
                                    the Char Aznable's Second Neo Zeon War. The conflict revolves around each respective
                                    side's quest to find a mysterious object known as "Laplace's Box", and the battles
                                    fought over control of its "key", the RX-0 Unicorn Gundam. Although the contents of
                                    the box are unknown, the importance of Laplace's Box to both sides is significant
                                    since the box is rumored to be capable of destroying the Earth
                                    Federation.<br><br>Ever since the Laplace terror incident in UC 0001, the
                                    influential Vist Foundation possessed and protected a secret that held the power to
                                    either create the future that was envisioned when the Universal Century was created,
                                    or simply destroy the world. This secret - Laplace's Box - created a precarious
                                    power balance in the Earth Sphere that has thus far endured for almost a hundred
                                    years. By UC 0096, most of the individuals involved with the box have died out, but
                                    the fear of the box's power, as well as the expectation to maintain the status-quo,
                                    have remained.

                                    Three years after Char's Rebellion was eventually quashed, what remained of Neo Zeon
                                    continued a guerilla campaign against the Federation with the covert support of some
                                    colonies, several politicians, and (presumably) even the support of Anaheim
                                    Electronics. This group - nicknamed the Sleeves - was barely holding together and
                                    relied on the charisma and the leadership of Full Frontal - who is widely known as
                                    the Second Coming of Char Aznable - to continue.

                                    The Federation, similarly, was suffering from sheer attrition from its participation
                                    in the One Year War, the Gryps Conflict, and both Neo Zeon wars. Ever since the
                                    Second Neo Zeon War, the Federation has maintained a tight grip on space as they
                                    continued to hunt for Zeon Remnants in the Earth Sphere. During this time, little
                                    was done on environmental reclamation and the Earth's health had not improved over
                                    the years. These factors taxed the Federation to the brink of collapse and forced
                                    the Earth's economy and energy needs to now completely depend on the seven Sides and
                                    the Moon.

                                    However, most importantly, both sides by this point had completely forsaken their
                                    founding ideologies and have been reduced to shadows of their former selves with the
                                    Federation content with simply ruling over the Earth Sphere and Zeon continuing to
                                    fight the Federation for its own sake rather than for a cause. With both sides
                                    beginning to wear themselves out and make their relationship an eternally
                                    antagonistic one, the Vist Foundation realized that as things stand, the Earth
                                    Sphere would not be able to continue. They concluded that the time had come to
                                    change the power balance the box had established, and correct the inherent flaws of
                                    the Universal Century. But in order to do this, they had to give up the source of
                                    its prosperity and power - The box itself.</p>

                                    organization that primarily operate out of Palau, but they have secret ties to some
                                    Zeon Remnants, a multitude of Zeon sympathizer cells hiding on Earth, and certain
                                    government officials and right-wing political activists within the Republic of Zeon.
                                    Since the Sleeves have no formal ties to the Republic of Zeon's government, the
                                    Earth Federation does not recognize the Sleeves as a legitimate military

                                    The mobile suits used by the Sleeves consist of refurbished machines from the
                                    previous conflicts dating back to the One Year War, as well as a number of newer and
                                    one-off models that were obtained from Anaheim Electronics' factory in Granada in
                                    U.C. 0093. The Sleeves have no plans to mass-produce their own mobile suits due to
                                    resource limitations.<br><br> History<br><br>Following its defeat in Second Neo Zeon
                                    War in U.C. 0093, the scattered remnants of Newborn Neo Zeon entered a period of
                                    dormancy, during which Full Frontal, a Cyber Newtype altered to look like the MIA
                                    Zeon ace Char Aznable, stepped into the leadership vacuum and reorganized them into
                                    a cohesive group. In U.C. 0096, Full Frontal's Neo Zeon organization began ramping
                                    up its activity and became known to the Earth Federation as the "Sleeves". At this
                                    time, the Sleeves were presented with an irresistible opportunity by the Vist
                                    Foundation, which offered to give them Laplace's Box, a legendary object rumored to
                                    be capable of toppling the Federation. The Sleeves planned to use Laplace's Box to
                                    pick up where Newborn Neo Zeon and Char Aznable left off in their long struggle
                                    against the Federation, specifically by coercing the Federation into allowing the
                                    Republic of Zeon to remain independent long enough to establish what Full Frontal
                                    called the Side Co-Prosperity Sphere. This would unite the Sides under a
                                    self-sufficient economic system that would boycott the Earth, bringing about the
                                    dissolution of the Federation and making mass emigration of humanity to space a
                                    necessity.<br><br>

                                    However, the exchange of Laplace's Box was thwarted by the intervention of Londo
                                    Bell, the Federation's special forces unit ECOAS, and the Vist Foundation's RX-0
                                    Unicorn Gundam piloted by Banagher Links, the illegitimate son of Cardeas Vist. The
                                    ensuing rush for control of the Box and its "key", the Unicorn Gundam, became known
                                    as the Laplace Incident. The Sleeves expended a significant portion of their
                                    military power during the conflict, and coordinated with Zeon remnants on Earth to
                                    launch attacks on Dakar and Torrington Base. Ultimately, despite the efforts and
                                    sacrifices of numerous Sleeves members, and public revelation of the Box's secrets,
                                    the organization failed in its objectives. Full Frontal perished in battle, and most
                                    of the Sleeves' military assets were destroyed. Following the conclusion of the
                                    Laplace Incident, the few remaining members of the Sleeves dispersed.<br><br>

                                    In U.C. 0097, a group of Republic of Zeon members, lead by Zoltan Akkanen, used the
                                    iconography and name of the Sleeves in their attempt to capture the RX-0 Unicorn
                                    Gundam 03 Phenex when it reappeared within Earth. They used a number of remaining
                                    Mobile Suits used by the Sleeves, including the MSN-06S-2 Sinanju Stein and the
                                    NZ-999 II Neo Zeong. This group was ultimately defeated by Jona Basta working in
                                    tandem with the Phenex before it disappeared for parts unknown. Mineva Lao Zabi
                                    believed government forces within the Republic of Zeon were behind the attacks, but
                                    had no proof.<br><br>

                                    In U.C. 0100, the Republic of Zeon officially ceded its autonomy and rejoined the
                                    Earth Federation in accordance with the Granada Treaty. This effectively marked the
                                    end of Neo Zeon movements in the Earth Sphere until the emergence of Mars Zeon in
                                    U.C. 0120.</p>

                                    Anaheim has been the de facto corporation for numerous militaristic factions to have
                                    their Mobile Suit designs to life.<br><br>Following the events of the Second Neo
                                    Zeon War, the Earth Federation and Anaheim Electronics would work together for a
                                    brand new mobile suit project, the UC Project. The project would lead to the birth
                                    of the RX-0 Unicorn Gundam and its sibling units along with the RGM-96X Jesta series
                                    developed to defend them. The Earth Federation brass sought to use the UC Project to
                                    not only end Zeon influence but destroy the ideas of the Newtype. However, the Vist
                                    Foundation interfered, allowing the Unicorn Gundam to be outfitted with the La+
                                    System, a program designed to locate the Laplace Box. Doing this set off the Third
                                    Neo Zeon War as the remains of the Newborn Neo Zeon, "The Sleeves", sought to obtain
                                    the box to bring down the Earth Federation.<br><br>

                                    During this time, the Strategic Naval Research Institute would come into play,
