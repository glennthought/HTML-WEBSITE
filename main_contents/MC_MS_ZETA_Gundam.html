                            <p>It is U.C.0087, seven years after the end of the One Year War. After the events of
                                Operation Stardust, the Earth Federation establishes an elite counter-insurgency
                                division called the Titans to hunt down the remaining pockets of Zeon remnants. The
                                Titans become overzealous in their mission, start resorting to brutal methods to achieve
                                their goals, and become nothing more than ruthless tyrants with an ambition to rule the
                                Earth Sphere. Two anti-Titans resistance groups, the Anti-Earth Union Group (AEUG) and
                                their Earth-bound counterparts Karaba (led by Hayato Kobayashi), form to unite the
                                various existing small forces in the struggle against Titans. Their members consist of
                                renegade soldiers of the Earth Federal forces, former soldiers of Principality of Zeon,
                                and militia from space colonies. Most notable is Bright Noa, who returns as captain of
                                the assault cruiser Argama, the flagship of AEUG space fleet, and Quattro Bajeena, who
                                is really the legendary ace pilot Char Aznable, the "Red Comet".

                                <p>Kamille Bidan is the main protagonist of the Mobile Suit
                                    Zeta Gundam anime and a supporting character in Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ. He is most
                                    well known as the pilot of the MSZ-006 Zeta Gundam.<br><br>Kamille particularly
                                    hated his very feminine-sounding name - and thus violently asserts his manhood by
                                    developing a hobby in amateur mobile suit creation. This he might have inherited
                                    from his parents: both are Federation officers and among the main engineering team
                                    that designed the Titan's prototype unit, Gundam Mk-II. He also showed a willingness
                                    to fight by stealing a Gundam to step on a Titans officer who had previously
                                    interrogated and abused him. He also tends to be brash, thoughtless, somewhat
                                    self-important, and prone to acting on his own judgment, in addition to being
                                    arrogant in his own right. This leads to him getting more than his fair share of
                                    abuse, both mental and physical, at the beginning of the series, like being beaten
                                    badly by Wong Lee, and being slapped quite a few times for his bad attitude.
                                    However, he eventually comes under Char Aznable's influence as the series
                                    progresses. This mentor-protege relationship plays a great role in shaping Kamille
                                    from an emotionally vulnerable, angst-ridden teenager to a true soldier, though he
                                    remains highly fragile emotionally, which only continues to worsen as those he cares
                                    about die around him. This boils over with the deaths of both Henken Bekkner and his
                                    longtime rival, Jerid Messa, leaving a distraught Kamille to question the whole
                                    point of warfare in general.</p>

                                    Suit Zeta Gundam.<br><br>Originally a member of the Federation’s Jupiter Energy
                                    Fleet, Scirocco is often known as “The Man from Jupiter.” An intelligent and
                                    charismatic man, Scirocco is capable of gathering individuals, typically women, to
                                    his side by either persuasion or manipulation. Scirocco also has an arrogant
                                    personality, believing himself to be above all others as a man bringing about a
                                    great change for human history where humanity would be ruled by a select few. He
                                    could also be utterly ruthless, such as when he killed Jamitov to usurp him as
                                    leader of the Titans.<br><br>Jerid has the typical traits of a Titan member: being
                                    ruthless, egotistical, overconfident and an absolute disregard for the lives of
                                    civilians. Jerid has the ambition to one day become the Titans leader, but wishes to
                                    do so his own way without the help of others. However, despite his pride as an
                                    Earthnoid he would ask the help of Lila to better himself as a soldier. On a similar
                                    note, he is extremely arrogant to believe that the Titans have the power to deem
                                    what they do as right, despite that his arrogance only sparked hatred and mistrust
                                    to the public population. His rivalry with Kamille becomes bitter hatred when his
                                    comrades die one by one, and he blames Kamille's very existence for his loss.
                                    Ultimately, his arrogance and hatred brought forth his demise at the hands of his
                                    rival, and puts his ambitions to rest.</p>

                                <p>Haman Karn is an antagonist from Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam and
                                    the main antagonist in its sequel Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ. She also plays a major role
                                    in the Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Deleted Affair: Portrait Of Young Comet
                                    manga.<br><br>When first viewed, Haman comes off as a cool, collected, and hardened
                                    leader. Despite this, she is very charismatic and seems to care for the well being
                                    of her soldiers, even teaching the principles of war to some. However, all this is a
                                    ruse to cover up her true self; Haman's real character is one that desires power,
                                    not caring who she has to use or discard to get it.<br><br>

                                    She is noted to be very manipulative, playing on the fear or ambitions of others so
                                    as to use them. Both statements are proven near the end of the First Neo Zeon War,
                                    when Mashymre Cello, an extremely faithful and devoted subordinate, sacrifices
                                    himself to take out as many of her adversaries as possible, with Haman denouncing
                                    his move and showing no remorse at his death, even after she took the time to train
                                    him as a soldier.<br><br>

                                    Judau Ashta, upon first meeting her commented that he felt a dark, malevolent aura
                                    around her, thus reflecting the depth of her dark personality, possibly even
                                    implying she is truly evil. While she believes in reforming the Earth for the
                                    better, she has no tolerance for Earthnoids, viewing them as corrupt, greedy
                                    individuals whose "souls are weighed down by gravity," and as such must be rid of,
                                    if Earth is to be saved under the aristocratic rule of Spacenoids, with her herself
                                    as empress, reflecting she is a possible tyrant at heart.<br><br>

                                    It is important to note that Haman was not always the way she was during the events
                                    of Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam and Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ. The manga, Mobile Suit Gundam:
                                    Char's Deleted Affair: Portrait Of Young Comet, and its mini prequel, One Day:
                                    Haman's Deleted Affair, reveal that Haman had a sweet disposition as a young
                                    teenager. The latter manga reveals that Haman grew up in Axis after the One Year
                                    War, never having seen the Earth, and had to endure a hard life growing up as Axis
                                    was not well suited to support life, and it was not any better with the looming
                                    threat of the Federation possibly attacking them.<br><br>

                                    The former manga also shows she was a romantic of sorts, as she became romantically
                                    involved with Zeon's Red Comet, Char Aznable. Though CDA also reaffirms what was
                                    said in HDA, as Haman had to train to be a soldier and possibly felt obligated to
                                    protect the people on Axis, viewing their treatment by the Federation as unjust.
                                    Thus Haman's personality in the anime is a result of her troubled upbringing, never
                                    having had the chance to be a child and enjoy life, she became dark, cold, and
                                    isolated from the rest of the world, which she states in Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ is
                                    what made her stronger and is her core strength.<br><br>

                                    However, the original Haman never disappeared completely, as when she meets Judau,
                                    his personality and beliefs slowly begin to reawaken Haman's old self, which she
                                    herself notes, and is possibly why she feels a kindred spirit in Judau, as he shared
                                    the same personality she did when she was fourteen. In their climactic duel at the
                                    end of the series, Haman reveals that she is happy to have met Judau, possibly
                                    because he represented what she could have become, had she not let herself be
                                    corrupted by war.</p>

                                <p>Amuro was placed under house arrest shortly after the war due to the government's
                                    mistrust of Newtypes. While he lived in a luxurious mansion (possibly paid for by
                                    either royalties from patenting his Haro design as popular toys, or abundant war
                                    pensions for his military service) and was officially free to come and go as he
                                    pleased, Amuro's house servants were actually government agents assigned to keep
                                    track of his movements. Amuro worked as a maintenance worker in the Cheyenne Mobile
                                    Suit Academy up until the time of the Gryps Conflict. He suffered from chronic
                                    combat fatigue, as commented by Emma Sheen and Beltorchika Irma, likely from his
                                    traumatic experience during the One Year War and the sense of guilt over killing
                                    Lalah Sune.<br><br>

                                    During the Gryps War, a pregnant Fraw Bow, with her three adopted children, came to
                                    visit Amuro. They managed to re-ignite Amuro's fighting spirit and helped him escape
                                    from his government handlers. After joining the Karaba (AEUG's earth-bound ally),
                                    Amuro became a key figure within the group, leading several crucial missions,
                                    including the attack on the Titan's base in Mount Kilimanjaro and the seizing of
                                    Federation's Congress Building in Dakar. After the operation in Dakar, and the
                                    AEUG's return to space, Karaba receives their new shipment of mass-produced Zeta
                                    Gundams, the MSZ-006A1 Zeta Plus A1's to enhance their fighting strength. Amuro was
                                    given a Zeta Plus in his custom colors and was made commander of the 18th Tactical
                                    Fighter Aggressor Squadron (18TFAS) as part of the Karaba Air Force, and would be of
                                    great use in fighting both the remaining Titans on Earth, and the newly emerged
                                    Neo-Zeon.<br><br>With the defeat of the Titans and subsequent end of the Gryps War,
                                    both the AEUG and Karaba turned their attention towards the new threat that appeared
                                    during the war, Neo Zeon and its leader Haman Karn. As the AEUG had been greatly
                                    weakened in the previous battle, Karaba, whose strength remained mostly intact, sent
                                    a good amount of their pilots to into space to back up the AEUG.<br><br>



                                    In Gundam ZZ Hayato Kobayashi reveals that Amuro was among those who were sent to
                                    space to fight Neo-Zeon (episode 35), though Amuro himself never appears in the
                                    series. In Gundam Evolve, it is revealed that after his transfer Amuro was made part
                                    of a special team of pilots that were to pilot three new Zeta Gundam units, with
                                    Amuro as the team leader. So to hide his identity from the enemy, thereby taking
                                    them by surprise, Amuro was given the code name White Unicorn and was assigned the
                                    MSZ-006-3A Zeta Gundam 3A Type to pilot. He and his team, consisting of Red Snake
                                    (Yurii Ajissah) and Gray Wolf (Shin Matsunaga), would be critical in repelling the
                                    Neo-Zeon forces throughout the First Neo Zeon War (though they did not participate
                                    in the final battle).</p>

                                    moved, and the objective could not be achieved. After the operation, they joined
                                    forces with a support organization, Karaba, and attempted to leave the Earth. In

                                <p>The MSZ-006 Zeta Gundam is the titular mobile suit of the anime Mobile Suit Zeta
                                    Gundam. It is also featured in the sequel series Mobile Suit Gundam
                                    ZZ.<br><br>Developed as part of Project Zeta, a third generation
                                    mobile suit development plan launched by Anaheim Electronics upon request from the
                                    AEUG, the Zeta Gundam was a revolutionary Transformable Mobile Suit (TMS). While
                                    Anaheim's previous attempt at creating a TMS, the MSN-001 Delta Gundam, failed due
                                    to issues with its transformable movable frame, the Zeta Gundam solved this problem
                                    by studying the design concept of the RX-178 Gundam Mk-II's movable frame, which had
                                    an excellent basic design.[4][5] In addition, it adopted Gundarium γ alloy armor,
                                    previously used on Anaheim's RMS-099 Rick Dias.[6]<br><br>

                                    The Zeta Gundam was capable of transforming into a cruising mode known as "Wave
                                    Rider Mode". In this form, the Zeta Gundam adopted a wedge shape, concentrating the
                                    shockwave generated by supersonic flight underneath it and riding the resulting
                                    wave, hence its name. In this form, it was capable of entering the atmosphere
                                    without any optional equipment thanks to the Flying Armor mounted on the movable
                                    frame on its back, which protected it from shockwave and heat during atmospheric
                                    entry. The Flying Armor was based on data from the support vehicle of the same name,
                                    and could be replaced with other equipment, such as the Wing Binders for the Wave
                                    Shooter specification.[4][7] The Wave Rider Mode could also function as a sub-flight
                                    system for other mobile suit.[5]<br><br>

                                    Due to the Zeta Gundam's complex transformation mechanism, it was impossible to
                                    mount generators in its upper body. Instead, it was equipped with a generator in
                                    each shin, a design concept inspired by the RX-78GP01-Fb Gundam "Zephyranthes" Full
                                    Burnern.[4][8] Its legs were also installed with thermonuclear jet/rocket hybrid
                                    engines, which were capable of functioning both in space and in the atmosphere,
                                    allowing the Zeta Gundam to engage in aerial combat immediately after atmospheric
                                    entry.[7]<br><br>

                                    The Zeta Gundam's weapons were highly systematic and presented almost no hindrance
                                    when carried. It was armed with a pair of head-mounted vulcan guns, a pair of beam
                                    sabers stored in the side skirt armor that served as beam guns in Wave Rider Mode, a
                                    pair of forearm-mounted grenade launchers, an E-pac powered beam rifle, a shield
                                    attached to the left forearm that served as the Wave Rider Mode's nose unit, and the
                                    Hyper Mega Launcher, a powerful beam weapon developed from the MSN-00100 Hyaku
                                    Shiki's Mega Bazooka Launcher. Thanks to these weapons, it was capable of handling
                                    nearly all battlefield situations.[5][7][9]<br><br>

                                    Finally, the Zeta Gundam was equipped with the Bio-Sensor, a Quasi-Psycommu device
                                    that assisted with the mobile suit's controls using the pilot's brainwaves,
                                    improving its responsiveness. Though details about this device was unclear, there
                                    were instances of it allowing the Zeta Gundam to demonstrate abilities beyond its
                                    specifications during combat.[10][11] Overall, the Zeta Gundam had exceptionally
                                    high operability and was regarded as a masterpiece of the Gryps Conflict era.[5]</p>

                                    Gundam. It is piloted by Haman Karn.<br><br>The AMX-004 Qubeley is a next generation
                                    mobile suit designed for Newtypes that features numerous technological innovations
                                    which allow it to fight on par with other advanced mobile suits that appeared during
                                    the Gryps Conflict and the First Neo Zeon War. Developed from the data gathered from
                                    the MS-09R4 Schnee Weiss and the AMX-001 Prototype Qubeley, the Qubeley featured
                                    four independently movable shoulder binders, two binders per shoulder, to assist in
                                    AMBAC (Active Mass Balance Auto Control), granting phenomenal mobility. Though
                                    lacking the full range of motion as the arms and legs, these binders bring the
                                    Qubeley's total number of movable limbs up to eight. Furthermore, these binders also
                                    contain the Qubeley's primary thrusters.<br><br>

                                    The most notable feature of the Qubeley is that it is the first combat mobile suit
                                    to be equipped with a mobile suit-sized psycommu system, which is used to control
                                    the new remote controlled weaponry known as "Funnels". The Prototype Qubeley
                                    featured a similar system, but its psycommu had not been fully miniaturized and the
                                    Funnels were stored in its main body, leaving it with a large body that stood 25
                                    meters tall. The system aboard the Qubeley had been perfected and its ten Funnels
                                    were stored in a container located in its rear armor, allowing for quicker
                                    deployment and recall. The Qubeley lacks the mega particle cannons of the prototype
                                    version, replacing them with a pair of dual-purpose beam guns that can double as
                                    beam sabers for close combat. Lastly, the Qubeley is one of the first Zeon mobile
                                    suits to use a dual-type optical sensor instead of the traditional mono-eye.</p>

                                    suits deployed by the AEUG in their fight against the corrupt Titans. Because many

                                    (Gamma Gundam) as it is built out of the new Gundarium γ. This material was
                                    developed by Axis and has strength similar to standard Gundarium yet weighs less,
                                    making the suit lighter and thus allowing it to accommodate a greater fuel capacity.

                                    The Rick Dias is one of the earlier mobile suits to use the 360-degree panoramic
                                    cockpit, and unlike most mobile suits, its cockpit is built into its head and not
                                    the torso. Its hands are equipped with specialized launchers that can be used to
                                    launch fire-suppressing gas or a binding adhesive. For combat, the Rick Dias can be
                                    equipped with a variety of weapons, making it a versatile mobile suit. Its standard
                                    weaponry included 55mm vulcan phalanx in its head, a pair of beam pistols stored in
                                    the backpack-mounted rack, and a beam saber stored on the underside of a
                                    backpack-mounted rack. It can also be optionally equipped with a clay bazooka and a
                                    beam rifle. Initially, the standard color scheme for the Rick Dias was black and
                                    dark gray, but this was later changed to a red color scheme that was first used by
                                    Quattro Bajeena's customized unit</p>

                                    —Beginning of Gundam Mk-II's unveiling speech at Gryps

                                    <br><br>A direct descendant of the RX-78-2 Gundam developed by the Titans, the
                                    Gundam Mk-II is the first mobile suit to utilize the new movable frame concept. In
                                    this new concept, rather than merely serving as a structural framework, the movable
                                    frame incorporates all the mobile suit's vital mechanisms, including the actuators
                                    and control systems required for movement, and excludes the mobile suit's weapons,
                                    armor, and propellant tanks. This approach dramatically improves the mobile suit's
                                    responsiveness, reliability, and energy efficiency, as well as making it far more
                                    agile than traditional designs.<br><br>

                                    Another characteristic of the Gundam Mk-II is that some of its legs' movable parts
                                    are exposed and this design feature is based on the prevailing idea at that time
                                    that avoiding being hit by the enemy is the preferable choice. The origin for this
                                    idea is because no existing armor can fully protect against beam weaponry, thus it
                                    is better to increase the mobile suit's mobility by weight reduction rather than
                                    equip more armor which would lead to a higher weight and lower mobility.<br><br>

                                    The mobile suit also has what had become the standard 360-degree panoramic screen
                                    and linear seat fitted in a circular cockpit that also functions as an escape pod.
                                    The multiple panels of the panoramic screen make up a single 360-degree display,
                                    covering the entire inner surface of the cockpit. The image displayed on this screen
                                    is a computer simulation constructed from the cameras distributed around the mobile
                                    suit's exterior. The viewpoint is that of the mobile suit's head, and the image is
                                    carefully edited to remove the mobile suit itself. The linear seat is suspended in
                                    the center of the cockpit, supported by a linear arm which electromagnetically
                                    counters G-forces and impact shocks in order to protect the pilot. Together, the
                                    panoramic screen and the linear seat gives the pilot a larger field of view and
                                    eliminates blind spots.<br><br>

                                    The most notable flaw of the Gundam Mk-II is that it is armored using the obsolete
                                    titanium alloy ceramic composite. Another flaw is that the movable frame's leg
                                    sections have rigidity issues associated with the strength of the structural
                                    material used, and this problem persisted even after six design revisions. Despite
                                    this, for a brief time period, the Gundam Mk-II's movable frame makes it one of the
                                    most agile mobile suits available. Three Gundam Mk-II were produced in total. They
                                    were later stolen by the Anti-Earth Union Group (AEUG) and given a new paint scheme.
                                    Despite being used by two different factions, the Gundam Mk-II's weaponry remains
                                    mostly unchanged. Its only fixed weapons are two beam sabers, but it can carry a
                                    vulcan pod, a shield, a beam rifle, a hyper bazooka and a clay bazooka if necessary.

                                    the anime Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam and featured in the sequel series Mobile Suit
                                    Gundam ZZ. It was primarily piloted by Quattro Bajeena during the Gryps Conflict and
                                    later by Beecha Oleg in the First Neo Zeon War.<br><br>The Hyaku Shiki is a mobile
                                    suit built by Anaheim Electronics as part of the "Zeta Project". It was originally
                                    designed as the prototype transformable mobile suit, MSN-001 Delta Gundam which
                                    incorporated Anaheim Electronics' own "movable frame" technology and
                                    backpack-mounted wing binders for additional mobility. However, defects in the frame
                                    design led to problems in its transformation and the machine's development was soon
                                    abandoned.<br><br>

                                    When the AEUG captured the Titans' RX-178 Gundam Mk-II, the movable frame technology
                                    of this newly acquired mobile suit assisted greatly in the advancement of the Zeta
                                    Project and also led to the redesigning of the Delta Gundam into the high
                                    performance, non-transformable Hyaku Shiki. Hyaku Shiki, which means 'Type 100' in
                                    Japanese, is named as such by its lead developer, Professor M.Nagano who hoped to
                                    create a mobile suit design that would endure for a hundred years. Because of the
                                    reliability of each device and its ease of access to the interior, the Hyaku Shiki
                                    was also used as a testbed for operational testing of various equipment under
                                    development.<br><br>

                                    The Hyaku Shiki's gold colored appearance is due to the application of a
                                    beam-resistant coating on its armor, giving it some limited protection against beam
                                    attacks. The suit also has a unique sensor called the Image Directive Encode (IDE)
                                    system, which emits a red pattern when scanning or during precision aiming. It also
                                    retains several design features from the original Delta Gundam design, most notably
                                    the legs' front armor and backpack-mounted wing binders. The Delta Gundam's
                                    transformation capabilities later resurfaced in the MSN-001A1 Delta Plus.</p>

                                    Admiral Maharaja Karn, Haman Karn. She used Dozle Zabi's daughter Mineva Lao Zabi as
                                    a figurehead and rallying point for the movement.<br><br>

                                    Interestingly the Second Neo Zeon Movement did not have any loyalty to the
                                    Principality of Zeon or the Zabi family. Led by Char Aznable who revealed that he
                                    was the son of Zeon Zum Deikun and thus the true heir of the Republic of Zeon, the
                                    goal of the Second Neo Zeon was to force humanity to move into space, and kill those
                                    that didn't, by dropping asteroids onto the Earth and starting a nuclear winter that
                                    would kill the majority of life on the planet. This, in turn, would achieve the two
                                    original goals set out by Zeon Deikun long ago: the first allowing the planet to
                                    rest (albeit entirely unable to support life after that), and the second
                                    establishing full independence for spacenoids from the rule of Earth. Almost three
                                    years later, the late Char Aznable's Neo Zeon's scattered forces would be gathered
                                    and reorganized by a man named Full Frontal. These remnants of the second Neo Zeon
                                    movement are referred to as "The Sleeves" by the Federation army, are not recognized
                                    legally, and are considered a terrorist organization.</p>

                                <p>The Anti Earth Union Group, more commonly known by
                                    their acronym as the AEUG is the main protagonist faction of Mobile
                                    Suit Zeta Gundam and Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ.<br><br>The AEUG is an anti-Federation
                                    movement which opposes the oppressive tactics of the Federation's elite Titans
                                    taskforce. The AEUG's ultimate political agenda was to reform the corrupt Earth
                                    Federation government, but after the Colony 30 Incident of U.C. 0085, the
                                    organization became focused on the more urgent task of fighting the Titans with
                                    military force.[1]<br><br>The AEUG was originally a political movement aiming to
                                    reform the corrupt Earth Federation government, but following the "30 Banchi
                                    Incident" in Side 1 due to the actions of the Titans, the AEUG took up arms against
                                    them. Composed of dissatisfied colonists, Federation soldiers who disowned the
                                    Titans and several former Zeon officials posing as Federation officers, One Year War
                                    veterans Bright Noa, Henken Bekkener and Quattro Bajeena (Char Aznable under a new
                                    alias) were some of the most notable members of the AEUG, alongside AEUG founder
                                    Blex Forer and Newtype civilian recruit Kamille Bidan, whose piloting skills and
                                    Newtype powers were among the best in Universal Century history.<br><br>

                                    In UC 0087, the AEUG raided a Titans' military facility in their colony base in Side
                                    2 called Green Noa 2 (also known as Gryps 2), stealing three new RX-178 Gundam Mk-II
                                    prototypes. This enraged the Titans, and following a chain of events due to the
                                    heist, the full-scale Gryps Conflict civil war for control of the space colonies
                                    erupted between the factions.<br><br>

                                    The AEUG utilized several models of mobile suits during the war, among them the
                                    Gundam Mk-II stolen from the Titans (the other two were turned over to Anaheim
                                    Electronics for analysis and reverse engineering), the prototype transformable
                                    mobile suit MSA-005 Methuss, the Federation-influenced MSA-003 Nemo and MSN-00100
                                    Hyaku Shiki, as well as the Zeon-influenced RMS-099 Rick Dias. The AEUG's main fleet
                                    was made up of several Salamis-class cruisers, at least five Irish-class
                                    battleships, and their flagship assault cruiser, the Argama. However, the most
                                    powerful weapon in the AEUG's arsenal was undoubtedly the transformable MSZ-006 Zeta
                                    Gundam. For the next year, the AEUG engaged the Titans around the Earth Sphere,
                                    finally managing to seize the upper hand and ultimately use the Titans' Gryps 2
                                    Colony Laser against them, destroying/disabling nearly every remaining ship in the
                                    Titan's fleet.<br><br>

                                    Unlike other military organizations within the Universal Century, the AEUG was
                                    primarily a rag-tag group consisting of renegades and some otherwise civilian
                                    fighters. Their main military force was made of defected ships, and for a
                                    considerable time, large numbers of RGM-79R GM IIs from the Federation forces, and
                                    whatever they could steal from the Titans. Uniform code and military procedure were
                                    especially lax, with the AEUG uniform simply being the Federation tunic minus the
                                    sleeves and with a V-neck; some members continued to wear the Federation Forces'
                                    uniform or simply civilian casual clothing. There also appeared to be no general
                                    recruitment standard other than being physically fit and able to serve. This could
                                    be considered an anti-thesis to the highly elitist and organized standards of the
                                    Titans.<br><br>

                                    Due to the Titans' activities placing numerous restrictions on trade and commerce,
                                    the AEUG and their Karaba allies activities were funded, to a large extent, by
                                    individuals and companies in the private sector notably the lunar organizations
                                    financing Anaheim Electronics, and the Earth-based Luio & Co. in Hong Kong.
                                    Unfortunately, this had the side-effect of putting many non-military officials into
                                    leadership positions; although Blex, Henken, Quattro and Bright were considered the
                                    AEUG's official leaders, there was no doubt their main influence came from Anaheim
                                    Electronics and other sponsors. The ineptness and indecisiveness of the AEUG's
                                    leadership, however, led to more than one blunder, namely the botched assault on the
                                    Federation's Jaburo base in South America and the attempted negotiations with the
                                    Zeon Remnants in the asteroid Axis.<br><br>

                                    When out on the field, the AEUG's sponsors would usually send a representative to
                                    oversee strategic movements and overall command. During the events of Gryps
                                    Conflict, one such representative, Anaheim Electronics's Wong Lee, spent a large
                                    amount of his time aboard the Argama. Bossy and argumentative, Wong frequently
                                    clashed with the Argama's officers and crew over everything from tactical procedures
                                    to the somewhat informal atmosphere aboard the warship.<br><br>

                                    While the AEUG and the Titans were busy fighting amongst one another, the real
                                    threat to the peace of the Earth Sphere, Axis Zeon, led by Haman Karn, emerged as
                                    the eventual victor. During the First Neo Zeon War, the AEUG's objectives shifted
                                    towards fighting the new Neo Zeon movement. However, the bulk of the AEUG was still
                                    recuperating from the Gryps Conflict, thus only the Argama and its skeleton crew
                                    initially saw action.<br><br>

                                    After the First Neo Zeon War, the AEUG officially disbanded, with most of its
                                    members going on to form the Federation's Londo Bell task force. Some members,
                                    however, disgruntled with the idea of rejoining a Federation which had not changed,
                                    went on to form orginizations such as Egum or Nouveau, carrying on the AEUG's fight
                                    as far as the U.C. 110s.</p>

                                    are the antagonist faction introduced in the anime Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam. They are
                                    also featured in Gundam Sentinel and Advance of Zeta: The Flag of Titans. Their
                                    original intention was to defend the Earth Federation against supporters of the
                                    former Principality of Zeon, as well as to investigate Zeon sympathizers. However,
                                    they eventually turned rogue, allying themselves with Axis Zeon in order to fight
                                    against the Anti-Earth Union Group in an attempt to gain control over the Earth
                                    Sphere. They were all but wiped out by the AEUG at the end of the Gryps Conflict.
                                    <br><br>The Titans were an elite autonomous counter-insurgency group whose purpose
                                    was to hunt down the remnant groups of the former Principality of Zeon and any other
                                    anti-Earth Federation organization. While technically a part of the Earth Federation
                                    Forces, the Titans operated under the sole control of Jamitov Hymen, functioning as
                                    his own personal military, and carried out violent actions with impunity, outside
                                    the limits of the Federation’s supervision. The Titan ranks were primarily made up
                                    of pro-Earthnoid soldiers, most of whom harbored heavy anti-Spacenoid sentiments and
                                    were known to use muscle and intimidation tactics to enforce their ranks, even
                                    against civilians, fellow Federal soldiers, and lesser Titans officers.
