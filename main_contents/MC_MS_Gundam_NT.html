                            <p>Mobile Suit Gundam Narrative is a 2018 Japanese animated film. The film is a sequel to
                                Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn and is loosely based on the novel Mobile Suit Gundam UC:
                                Phoenix Hunting.<br><br>U.C. 0097, one year after the opening of "Laplace's Box".

                                Despite the revelation of the Universal Century Charter that acknowledges the existence
                                and rights of Newtypes, the framework of the world has not been greatly altered.<br>

                                The conflict later dubbed the "Laplace Incident" is thought to have ended with the
                                downfall of the Neo Zeon remnants known as the Sleeves. In its final battle, two full
                                psycho-frame mobile suits displayed power beyond human understanding. The white unicorn
                                and the black lion were sealed away to remove this danger from people's consciousness,
                                and they should now be completely forgotten.<br><br>

                                However, the RX-0 Unicorn Gundam 03, which disappeared two years earlier, is now about
                                to show itself in the Earth Sphere once more. A golden phoenixâ€¦ named Phenex.[1]

                                    in the Earth Federation, Jona has been assigned to the Shezarr unit of the Earth
                                    Federation Forces Clop-class cruiser Damascus as part of the "Phoenix Hunt"
                                    taskforce at the request of the Luio & Co.[1]<br><br>Jona lost both his parents
                                    sometime during the One Year War. Due to the loss of records during the chaos of the
                                    war, the cause was undetermined. As such Jona grew up in foster care in Australia
                                    alongside Rita Bernal and Michele Luio, up until the Operation British colony drop,
                                    to which Rita had foreseen and warned about. After saving an entire town, they were
                                    dubbed the "Miracle Children".[3]<br><br>

                                    Following these events, the "Miracle Children" were sent to a Newtype testing
                                    facilities ran by Titans. After Michele's claim that Rita was the true Newtype,
                                    Michele was taken by Luio & Co. and Jona was released at the end of Gryps War, when
                                    the facility was shut down. Jona was subsequently able to obfuscate his past by
                                    erasing his records.[3]<br><br>

                                    Official Federation records claimed Jona was adopted by a North American family and
                                    enrolled into a EFSF military academy at age 18, graduated at 22, and was
                                    commissioned as an Ensign.[3]<br><br>

                                    Following their separation, Jona was able to reunite with Michele via her
                                    connections with Luio & Co.<br><br>

                                    leader of the Neo Zeon remnants, the Sleeves, he is a Cyber Newtype created as a
                                    second coming of Char Aznable. However, he is deemed to be a failure - a fact he is
                                    extremely insecure about. Because of this, he has an unrelenting need to prove
                                    himself to be worthy of the title.[1]<br><br>

                                    Zoltan has shown to be erratic, sadistic, and completely insane. He has shown little
                                    regard for the live of others, as he did not hesitate to fire his beam weapons in a
                                    space colony. His psychotic nature shows when he knowingly killed civilians with
                                    said beam weapons, while shooting at Jona Basta. He went as far as to use his
                                    senseless slaughter and destruction in an attempt to goad Jona into fighting
                                    back.[1]<br><br>

                                    His destructive and insane behavior seems to stem heavily from his insecurities;
                                    even minuscule implications of this fact are enough to sent Zoltan into fits of
                                    rage. Examples of this behavior include his first engagement with Jona, when he
                                    noticed Jona is a Cyber Newtype who isn't using the RX-9 Narrative Gundam to its
                                    fullest extent. Jona was unaware of the Narrative's full potential (in fact, Jona
                                    was actively trying to limit collateral damage in the colony), but Zoltan perceived
                                    Jona's behavior as a mockery from the opposing side, that his capabilities didn't
                                    justify the deployment of a better pilot or mobile suit. Another example of his
                                    insanity would be when he successfully used his Newtype powers to control the NZ-999
                                    II Neo Zeong's Psycho-Frame to grab, throw, crush, and detonate a large Helium-3
                                    tank. The massive destruction resulted in Zoltan laughing ecstatically.[1]</p>

                                    to dodge the High Mega Cannon beam from the RX-9/A Narrative Gundam A-Packs. Later,
                                    seeing how the Narrative was struggling to capture the Phenex, Iago instructed the
                                    rest of his team to provide help. However, after hearing Rita Bernal's voice from
                                    the Phenex, the Narrative's pilot, Jona Basta, decided to fire his High Mega Cannon
                                    at the Jestas to allow the Phenex to escape. Once again, Iago ordered his team to
                                    scatter, losing the Phenex in the process.<br><br>

                                    Back at the Damascus, Iago questioned Jona as he found the latter's background to be
                                    suspicious. During their argument, Jona dropped his lucky charm, which contains a
                                    fragment of the necklace that his father wore. Iago caught sight of it and wondered
                                    why he had it. Later, the Shezarr Unit's Jestas participated in a mock battle with
                                    the RX-9/B Narrative Gundam B-Packs. During the battle, one of Iago's subordinates
                                    noted that Jona's skills as a mobile suit pilot was average, and Iago remarked that
                                    it seemed Jona was not enhanced.<br>

                                    The Damascus then travelled to the colony "Metis", where the Phenex was supposedly
                                    detected. As the ship stayed outside the colony, the Jestas and Narrative Gundam
                                    B-Packs managed to enter it using Luio & Co.'s name. Inside the colony, Iago
                                    reminded his team that weapons fire here is forbidden and that they should herd the
                                    Phenex to the nearest docking bay when they found it. When one of the Jestas
                                    detected something in the sky, Jona rushed ahead and ignored Iago's attempts to call
                                    him back. As the Narrative Gundam B-Packs engaged with the MSN-06S-2 Sinanju Stein,
                                    Iago and his subordinates battled several AMS-129 Geara Zulu (Guards Type)s. When
                                    the Narrative's NT-D activated and it docked with the NZ-999 II Neo Zeong, Iago
                                    tried to get closer to talk some sense into Jona, but was blown away by a mysterious
                                    power. He then noted that this power felt similar to the Axis Shock that pushed the
                                    asteroid base, Axis, away from Earth several years prior. Jona later calmed down
                                    after hearing Rita's voice from the Phenex, and Iago retreated with his team back to
                                    the Damascus.<br><br>

                                    During the final battle at the helium-3 storage base, Iago sortied in his Jesta to
                                    help Jona and the Phenex against the II Neo Zeong. He believed that Jona and the
                                    Phenex could defeat the enemy, and revealed that he was there when the RX-93 Î½
                                    Gundam was trying to push back Axis. His unit was then hijacked by the II Neo Zeong,
                                    and he ordered Jona to shoot him down, but the latter refused. Iago's Jesta was
                                    freed when Michele Luio's Base Jabber exploded and landed on the wire used for
                                    hijacking his machine, he then retreated from the battle. After the battle ended,
                                    Iago stood on one of three Jestas' hand as the team arrived to pick up Jona.</p>

                                    mobile suit made by Anaheim Electronics, it was developed as a prototype for the
                                    RX-93 Î½ Gundam, testing the Psycho-Frame, and many portions of its body are made
                                    from identical parts.[1][2] Because it was intended mainly as a testbed for data
                                    collection, there are many areas that have not been equipped with armor, leaving the
                                    frame structure exposed.[1][2] The base machine is armed only with head vulcans, and
                                    during Operation Phoenix Hunt it uses a variety of interchangeable armament provided
                                    by Luio & Co.[1][2] The Narrative's cockpit lacks the standard 360 degree panoramic

                                    the durability and follow-up capabilities of the Psycho-Frame.[1] Two units of the
                                    Mobile Suit, referred to using the development code "Stein 01", were later stolen by

                                    unit was seen in the fight over the RX-0 Unicorn Gundam 03 Phenex and was

                                <p>The ARX-014S Silver Bullet Suppressor is a variant of the ARX-014 Silver Bullet from
                                    Mobile Suit Gundam Narrative and is piloted by Banagher Links.<br><br>The ARX-014S
                                    Silver Bullet Suppressor is a remodeled version of a ARX-014 Silver Bullet stored in
                                    the Magallanica.[1][2] The main reason for the remodeling was to enable it to use
                                    the RX-0 series' Beam Magnum.[1] To accomplish this, its right arm is modified to be
                                    exchangeable, its backpack is changed to one that stores four replacement arms and
                                    an arm exchange system consisting of a crane and rail is installed on the rear waist
                                    armor.[1][2] These measures allow the exchange of the right arm after each shot of
                                    the Beam Magnum, countering the malfunctions that occurred to the arm due to its
                                    intense recoil.[1][2]<br><br>

                                    Other notable modifications include its face being greatly different, the number of
                                    antennas are increased to a total of six, modified knees and new feet.[1][2] All of
                                    the modifications are possible due to the high extensibility of the original Silver
                                    Bullet.[1] The colors of the mobile suit have also been changed to a black color
                                    scheme.[1][2] Besides the Beam Magnum, the Silver Bullet Suppressor's other
                                    armaments consisted of 60mm Vulcan Guns, Beam Sabers, Grenade Launchers and Beam
                                    Cannons.[2] The "Suppressor" in its name is said to signify that "the mobile suit is
                                    to deter and restrain hostile organizations".[1]

                                <p>The RAS-96 Anksha is a mass-production transformable mobile suit introduced in Mobile
                                    Suit Gundam Unicorn.<br><br>The RAS-96 Anksha was developed as the successor to the
                                    NRX-044 Asshimar, but shares many interior components with the RGM-89 Jegan. This
                                    enhanced maintenance and production efficiency, as well as reduced manufacturing
                                    cost. Like the Asshimar, the Anksha is capable of high-altitude atmospheric flight
                                    without the help of a sub-flight system while in its mobile armor mode. With the
                                    application of magnetic-coating technology on its joints and moving parts, the
                                    Anksha can transform between mobile suit and mobile armor modes in a matter of
                                    seconds. The Anksha was able to serve as a sub-flight system for other mobile suits
                                    in the same fashion as a Base Jabber. It was also able to respond flexibly to
                                    high-altitude interceptor missions.<br><br>

                                    Unlike the Asshimar and more like Federation suits of the era, the Anksha abandons
                                    its predecessor's mono-eye sensor in favor of the typical compound sensor unit as
                                    seen on the Jegan and RGZ-95 ReZEL. Similar to the Asshimar, the head is equipped
                                    with internal differential pressure sensors and air traffic control radar. Other
                                    enhancements made to the Anksha from the Asshimar's original design included a
                                    larger number of stabilizers and flight-surfaces, increasing the unit's stability
                                    during flight. Interestingly, the suit also incorporated technology from ORX-005
                                    Gaplant in the form of the forearm-mounted movable shield binders which also contain
                                    the suit's beam rifles.</p>

                                    a prototype ground-use mobile suit developed by Karaba (hence the 'K' in its model
                                    number), the earthbound counterpart of the AEUG, based on the RMS-099 Rick Dias that
                                    AEUG left behind after the assault on Jaburo. Karaba put all of its industrial
                                    capabilities and technologies supplied by AEUG into building the suit, and although
                                    it uses avionics from the AEUG's MSA-003 Nemo, its specifications are far better and
                                    worthy of an ace-use machine. Like the Rick Dias, many former Zeon engineers were
                                    involved in the Dijeh's development, hence its design has many Zeon-style features,
                                    such as the mono-eye sensor. Another similarity with the Rick Dias is that the
                                    Dijeh's cockpit is also located in its head.<br><br>

                                    To adapt to ground operations, the suit's cooling system is improved and lightened.
                                    Furthermore, large heat radiator fins are mounted on its back, and the suit can
                                    hover over the ground due to the vectoring nozzle type jet thrusters installed in
                                    the legs. The suit also features enhanced communication capabilities due to the
                                    blade antenna on the head and rod-shaped multi-antennas (also known as radar
                                    receivers) mounted on top of the heat radiator fins. Amuro Ray, Karaba's ace and
                                    eventual pilot of the Dijeh, participated in the suit's development at the final
                                    stage and suggested the weapons rack on the left shoulder. Armament-wise, the suit
                                    has a pair of vulcan guns, a beam naginata, a shield on the right shoulder, and uses
                                    the beam rifle used by the AEUG's MSN-00100 Hyaku Shiki, as well as the Rick Dias'
                                    clay bazooka. It can also use the same hyper mega launcher as the MSZ-006 Zeta
                                    Gundam.<br><br>

                                    In U.C.0097, Luio & Co. operated a number of dark gray-colored Dijehs that were
                                    equipped with beam rifles modified to use the same standard E-pac as the beam rifles
                                    of RGM-89D Jegan D Type and RGZ-95 ReZEL. Additionally, the commander-use unit has a
                                    searchlight on its left shoulder.</p>

                                <p>An elite mobile suit team of the Earth Federation Forces, the Shezarr Team was based
                                    on the Clop-class cruiser Damascus. In U.C. 0097, the team was given a top secret
                                    assignment by the General Staff Headquarters: the capture of the RX-0 Unicorn Gundam
                                    03 Phenex, which went missing in U.C. 0095, but unexpectedly resurfaced after the
                                    Laplace Declaration. For this mission, the entire team was outfitted with customized
                                    Jesta outfitted with special equipment.[1]<br><br>

                                    The team eventually encountered and engaged the Phenex in the shoal zone near Side
                                    4, but the Phenex evaded all of the team's attempts to capture it. They were
                                    suddenly joined in the pursuit by Jona Basta in the RX-9/A Narrative Gundam A-Packs.
                                    Eventually, Jona got close enough to the Phenex to launch a communication wire at
                                    it, causing the Narrative to be dragged along by the Phenex.[1]<br><br>

                                    Shezarr Unit's team leader, Iago Haakana, asked Jona to drag the Phenex to the
                                    designated point. However, the voice of Rita Bernal suddenly began emanate from the
                                    Phenex, much to the shock of everyone present. In response, Jona severed the wire
                                    and fired the Narrative's mega particle cannon at it, only to miss and allow the
                                    Phenex to escape.[1]</p>

                                <p>The Republic of Zeon is a nation featured in the Mobile Suit
                                    Zeta Gundam television series and the Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn OVA. It existed
                                    before the Principality of Zeon and later would become its successor
                                    state.<br><br>In U.C.0053, Zeon Zum Deikun was appointed Prime Minister of Side 3.
                                    On September 14, U.C.0058, Side 3 declared independence and established the Republic
                                    of Zeon. In U.C.0068, Deikun suddenly died of a heart attack during a parliamentary
                                    speech. When Degwin Sodo Zabi took control, he wiped out the opposition and
                                    abolished the Republic on August 15, 0069, and declared a transition to a monarchy.
                                    The Zabi family, having gained power, aimed for independence from the Federation
                                    government by force. On January, U.C. 0079, the Zeon War of Independence (One Year
                                    War) began. With the destruction of the Zabi family during the closing stages of the
                                    One Year War, the Principality of Zeon transitioned to a Republic just before the
                                    end of the war and returned to its name of Republic of Zeon. During the First Neo
                                    Zeon War in U.C.0088, Side 3 along with the Republic, came under control of Neo Zeon
                                    and would eventually be liberated by the AEUG and Federation fleet after the
                                    self-destruction of Neo Zeon.<br><br>

                                    Following the One Year War, the Republic of Zeon was created with a pro-Earth
                                    Federation government led by Darcia Bakharo. Although regarded by some as a
                                    Federation puppet government, the Republic had been granted a degree of autonomy.
                                    However, the Federation planned to dissolve the Republic by U.C. 0100, which would
                                    cause the name of Zeon and his Newtype theory to fade into obscurity. Republic of
                                    Zeon defense minister Monaghan Bakharo would devise the Co-Prosperity Sphere plan
                                    and sponsored the Neo Zeon remnants movement, known as the Sleeves, led by Full
                                    Frontal to continue the fight for Spacenoid independence. When the Vist Foundation
                                    offered them Laplace's Box, an enigmatic object that had the power to topple the
                                    Federation government, Frontal intended to use it as a time saver to forestall the
                                    dissolution of the Republic so it could help in the formation of the Side
                                    Co-Prosperity Sphere, which would boycott the Earth, forcing mass space migration
                                    and causing the Federation government to collapse. However, following the defeat of
                                    the Sleeves in the Laplace Incident, the Republic of Zeon retired their independence
                                    in U.C. 0100 and was folded back into the Earth Federation.</p>
